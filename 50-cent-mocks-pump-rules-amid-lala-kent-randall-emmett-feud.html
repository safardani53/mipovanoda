The drama between the 43-year-old rapper and the Bravo star, 29, started on Friday, April 26, when 50 Cent shared a clip of Kent discussing how Emmett, 48, bought her a Range Rover and “really expensive gifts” after they slept together for the first time.
After the Grammy winner called Kent a “hoe” for how her relationship with her now-fiancé began, the SUR hostess accused 50 Cent of trying to “diminish the validity of the #MeToo movement” via Instagram Live."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I have your back,” Kent told her followers amid the drama. “We need to let these f–kers know that they are not safe because once they think they’ve silenced us, we are all f–ked.”</p><p>50, who retaliated by comparing Emmett to <a href=#>disgraced movie producer</a> <strong><a href=#>Harvey Weinstein</a></strong>, then shifted the conversation to the $1 million that the couple allegedly owe him. In a series of text messages between 50 Cent and Emmett, who previously produced the show Power together, the musician demanded his money by Monday, April 29.
