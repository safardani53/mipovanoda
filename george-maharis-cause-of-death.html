On the show, George played Buz Murdock, a man who came from Hell's Kitchen and teamed up with Martin's character to travel across the country in a shiny new corvette. The two drove along the titular route, and each week they would experience an entirely new adventure in a different location.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The show became immensely popular, in part because of its use of locations from across the country and also because of George's starring turn. Route 66 also featured a lineup of great guest actors, many of whom went on to become legends in Hollywood. Those actors included Robert Redford, Alan Alda, James Caan, and Robert Duvall. The show was unique in its time for filming on location, which meant that it doubled as a solid tourism ad for the entire western half of the country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">George left 'Route 66' following its third season.</h2><p>After three seasons, George left the show behind to pursue other opportunities, but he never again found the same level of fame that he had had on the series. He starred in a number of films after leaving the show, but none of them were major hits, although he continued to work consistently well into the '90s. His last filmed role was in 1993, after which he seems to have retired from show business altogether.</p><p>George was born and raised in Hell's Kitchen in New York City, where his family owned a successful restaurant. As he came of age, his parents wanted him to work in the family business. Ultimately, though, he wanted to pursue his own ambitions instead.</p><p>"Growing up in Hell's Kitchen, at least for me, was all about 'I'm not gonna stay here,'" he said in a 2007 interview. "Life is all about the journey, the going. I had to get out."</p><p>His initial goal was to become a singer, but an injury to his vocal cords ultimately led him to switch to acting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLKwvsaeZKaZmJa%2Fqr%2BMnJiuq5VivKd5w56YraA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
