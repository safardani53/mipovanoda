90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days has pulled a fast one before.
There is at least some evidence that Mahogany could be partially real.

Also, his acting career is just local theater stuff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Ben does seem to have a real interest in, well, being in the spotlight.</p><p>That’s not necessarily a bad thing, and it more or less describes literally every reality star.</p><p>You don’t sign up for reality TV without having at least some sort of interest, direct or indirect, in doing it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Ben’s past statements about fame also suggest that he has a real interest in it and has put thought into it.</p><p>In his estimation, if you don’t have a message to share, there’s no point in having a platform.</p><p>In his case, Ben says, he hopes to spread a spiritual message of "hope."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So let’s look at the story, as Ben tells it, of how he was contacted by another reality show.</p><p>"One of my fitness pictures got put into a men’s magazine, and from there a couple producers got a hold of me," Ben shared on social media.</p><p>Producers called him "and said, “Hey, how would you like to be in a reality TV show?” And I was, like, ‘Yeah! Maybe. I mean, if it’s fun. And if there’s a free trip involved.’"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"And then they told me what it was about, and I was, like, ‘No. I’m out. Nope. Not good,’" Ben recalled.</p><p>"I got kids. They’re gonna see that," he explained.</p><p>"I’m not gonna go on an island and be a part of that craziness," Ben affirmed, "where you’re just, like — you’ve all seen those kind of shows."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"But then something else kinda came up," Ben said, in clear reference to 90 Day Fiance: Before The 90 Days.</p><p>"And," he continued, "I was like, “Yeah. That one I can do.”</p><p>That’s interesting, especially since he admitted it himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Now … maybe he and Mahogany were already talking at this point.</p><p>Or maybe he needed to find an engaging plus one ASAP to make his fame dream come true.</p><p>So, how exactly did he and Mahogany start talking?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Ben shared that a coworker had suggested a few years ago that he could make good money as a fitness model.</p><p>Companies were looking for "old dudes with abs," and Ben certainly fits the bill.</p><p>As his pics became featured in magazines and showed up online, he says, he and Mahogany crossed paths online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It looks like what (allegedly) happened is that Mahogany, or the account that created the "Mahogany" identity, saw a DILF model and followed him.</p><p>He sent her a handwave emoji … which is a bold first move. (Sliding into DMs is sliding into DMs)</p><p>From there, they started chatting … and just a handful of months later, he was on a plane and headed to see her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"To answer some of your questions: Is it real? Like, is reality TV real? There is a lot of realness," Ben recently wrote on social media.</p><p>I mean, Hollywood actors spend their entire lives honing their skills to be able to cry on camera and to look real," he observed.</p><p>"Reality TV just is real," Ben noted. "That’s why people are so compelled."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Ben continued: "because I’m showing a part of my life that is very raw, and sometimes humiliating and embarrassing."</p><p>"And sometimes really inspiring. And it’s just all me," he added. "So to answer that question: Yeah. Yeah, it’s real."</p><p>"It’s going to be an exciting story filled with drama, intrigue, and — I can’t tell everything. In fact, they said ‘no spoilers.’"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"So, you’ll just have to watch," Ben teased. "Not even my own family really knows much of what’s happening."</p><p>Ben concluded: "But it’s gonna be — it’s gonna be crazy. So stay tuned. Not even I know the end of this thing."</p><p>So … what are we to make of this?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>There is a real person on the other end of Ben’s messages, but Ben’s been lied to about her age and possibly much more.</p><p>As for Ben, he seems like an overly earnest and somewhat foolish man.&nbsp;</p><p>We don’t think that production conjured him up as part of a fake storyline. We do think that he lept at the chance to be on TV, and may have rushed things with Mahogany to that end.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2V%2BcK7Ep2SrmaSdr7a6jKKqZqCVYsGpsYxyZ2acka56p7XAp5qeZZanrrawjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
