What a f-cking a–hole.” Novak, 34, has refused to get vaccinated against <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>COVID-19</a>, and Australian authorities detained him when he flew into the country on Jan. 5, ahead of the Australian Open.

That’s it. Goodbye,” he said. Howard’s co-host, <strong>Robin Quivers</strong>, brought up how Novak and his wife <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>came down with COVID</a>, which didn’t calm Howard down. “He’s a douchebag. Douche. He’s a f-ckwit,” said Stern.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“He doesn’t care about anyone else,” continued Howard. “His statement was, ‘Getting vaccinated is a private decision and it shouldn’t be mandated.’ Well, stay away from other people. That’s like saying smoking is a private decision. Well, that’s true. But don’t smoke in my face, f-cknut. What a dummy. Just a big dumb tennis player.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Howard-Stern-Goes-Off-Novak-Djokovic-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Though he was one of the “handful” of people granted a medical exemption to Australian law, Djokovic was detained when he arrived at the Australian border, and his visa was canceled. A judge ruled that the tennis star was treated unfairly, and ordered his release from an immigration detention center, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a>. “I am pleased and grateful that the judge overturned my visa cancellation,” he posted on Instagram afterward. “Despite all that has happened in the past week, I want to stay and to try to compete at the Australian Open. I remain focused on that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Djokovic’s stance on vaccines isn’t a secret. “Personally, I am <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>opposed</a> to vaccination, and I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,” he said during a Facebook Live session, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Newsweek</a>. “But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision. I have my own thoughts about the matter and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don’t know.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5BrZqGnp5a%2FpXnSrZyrpl2ZtrS%2FxKxkp6emlrhusMmooqiumZh6t63CnKCnnV2htrTAxKdm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
