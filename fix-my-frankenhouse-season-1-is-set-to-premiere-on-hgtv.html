She saw that if you opened the fridge door, it would strike the store, and if you tried to retrieve anything from beneath the sink, the door would hit the stove.</p><p>According to the network’s news release:</p><p>“As the season progresses, Mike and Denese will work with their fathers, master carpenters John Butler and Peter Doyle, to deliver one-of-a-kind projects for each family, including an island with a built-in bench seat and a repurposed antique chest.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Mike Butler claimed that multiple owners may make improvements to a home over time, ultimately turning it into a “frankenhouse.” He went on to say that his favorite aspect of the work is resolving difficulties for the people that live in such houses.&nbsp;As part of his employment, he reorganizes the floor plans and creates new layouts that maximize functionality.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Fix-My-Frankenhouse-2.jpg alt="Fix My Frankenhouse" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Denise noted that after the pair completes the new arrangement of the space, she would utilize a coherent contemporary design to restore “flow” to the home. The Fix My Frankenhouse cast member said that their customers don’t always know what they want, and it’s her responsibility to guide them through the design process.&nbsp;The Solution While speaking with House Digest, My Frankenhouse hosts talked out about filming the HGTV program. According to Denese, each property on the program has a distinct look that reflects the owners.</p><p>She hopes that the program would inspire viewers to “tap into who they are and draw out certain cool aspects” of themselves and integrate them into their houses.&nbsp;On HGTV, the season debut of Fix My Frankenhouse season 1 will air on Sunday, April 23 at 9 p.m. ET.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Fix My Frankenhouse Season 1</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>HGTV</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGidorBdosZustGapaSdnp28tr%2FEZqqemaOku259jKKqZquVqXq1u4ypqZ6lmZq%2FpnnOp2Shn6SrfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
