Bobby’s death played out in an episode in season 3 of <i>RHONY</i>, which saw Bethenny fly from New York City to Los Angeles to see her father for the last time. At first, Bobby refused to speak to his daughter but changed his mind and met with Bethenny on his deathbed.&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The <i>Apprentice: Martha Stewart </i>alum shares Bryn with ex<a href=#><span class=s2> <b>Jason Hoppy</b></span></a>.

You’re physically more psychological healthy. You’re not a wreck all the time. It’s like you can have a slightly normal life and you’re more connected with Bryn because you’re not in a panic about what will happen with the emails.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In August, Hoppy’s lawyer, Robert Wallack, confirmed to<i> Us Weekly</i> that the businessman, 49, and the Bravo star are<a href=#> <span class=s2>still legally married</span></a>.
