MALC (2.25 Newmarket, nap)
He was a fantastic second in the Group 2 Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot last time. He was well in front in his group and finished with something left in the tank so this extra furlong holds no fears."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There’s a lot more to come.</p><p>Saint George had already proven himself over a staying trip when scoring in a Doncaster handicap before stepping up to finish second in the Group 2 Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot.</p><p>That’s pretty strong form and a repeat would make him a big threat.</p><p>Tower Of London was a Listed winner at Leopardstown before dropping into handicap company to score at Down Royal 19 days ago. He is another open to lots of improvement.</p><p>Klondike was green when finishing second in decent company at Goodwood last time.</p><p>William Haggas’s hope is certain to improve for this longer trip as well as that outing and can’t be written off.</p><p>2.25</p><p>MALC caught the eye when winning on debut at Carlisle but left that form behind with an excellent second in the Group 2 Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot.</p><p>He stayed on strongly over the minimum trip and should relish this extra furlong.</p><p>Mountain Bear didn’t have a lot to beat in a Curragh maiden last time but did it nicely.</p><p>He didn’t have the best of the draw and the Aidan O’Brien runner is likely to show plenty more here.</p><p>Lake Forest did well to win so easily at Haydock on debut after missing the kick.</p><p>Despite his obvious inexperience, he made up plenty of ground and looks a nice prospect.</p><p>Maximum Impact was backed off the boards before finishing dead last in the Windsor Castle.</p><p>He was flying before that and is capable of bouncing back.</p><p>Fellow Amo Racing hope Thunder Blue was hampered when fifth in the Norfolk and can show more.</p><p>Chief Mankato won well on debut but had played up in the stalls at Royal Ascot and had to be withdrawn. He has ability if he can overcome that.</p><p>3.00</p><p>MILL STREAM was behind Quinalt and Washington Heights at York but there wasn’t much in it and he has fewer miles on the clock than the others.</p><p>This trip is ideal and he can improve with the other two also in the hunt.</p><p>Be Frank was impressive at Windsor and a 5lb rise is fair. This is stronger but he can’t be dismissed.</p><p>Eminency is another from that York race with a chance while Frankness can figure if breaking better after his slow start at Royal Ascot.</p><p>Tajalla should appreciate this extra furlong and hasn’t been clobbered by the handicapper after a good Sandown Listed effort.</p><p>3.35</p><p>ADAYAR looks on a different level if able to show the form of his Gordon Richards Stakes success here on comeback.</p><p>He wasn’t disgraced in a Royal Ascot Group 1 last time when the yard was going through a slump.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Israr is the threat after a couple of solid seconds this season.
