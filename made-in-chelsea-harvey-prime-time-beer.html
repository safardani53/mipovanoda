The ambitious 27-year-old worked to create a craft beer brand called Prime Time with former co-star Sam Holmes.
The dynamic duo tapped into an untouched market by launching a low calorie lager, which doesn't compromise on taste or alcohol content.
Harvey's now a millionaire with hopes his company will be worth £250million by 2030."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You're in a bubble and everyone gets on top of each other.</p><p>"It was quite tough."</p><p>Since joining the E4 show four years ago, Harvey's become a lead character in the BAFTA-winning non-scripted reality show.</p><p>But he doesn't shy away from the real reason he chose to put his life on the telly, admitting: "Fortune over fame has always been my goal, but if fame can support my journey to fortune then that was something I was willing to do.</p><p>"You can use the show and the profile to support the success of a business.&nbsp;</p><p>"A lot of celebrities put their name to alcohol brands, like David Beckham, Kylie Jenner, The Rock, but it most likely won't be them plugging away on the numbers. On a smaller scale I'm trying to be the business guy and the face.&nbsp;</p><p>"I have a very ambitious target to sell the company with a £250million valuation in five to seven years. I just need to power forward to that, but we're on track.</p><p>"And I enjoy&nbsp;doing Made in Chelsea - it adds value to what I do and I think I've gone through the hardest part.</p><p>"I've put my life on that show - I've fallen in love, I've broken my heart, broken a girl's heart, I've moved in with a girl and moved out, and all the other silly things in between.</p><p>"But I'd be wary of getting into a relationship on the show again. I think the fun, free and single route is easier."</p><p>Harvey's a regular in popular Chelsea clubs on the show - and he's even opening a bar in the area later this spring which will sell his low-calorie lager.</p><p><a href=# aria-label="Prime Time (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Time</a>, he says, is for beer lovers who are health conscious and fitness focused, but still looking to enjoy themselves on a night out.</p><p>It's gluten free, vegan friendly and is just 95 calories per bottle at 4.2% ABV.</p><p>"It has 30 per cent less calories than standard lager and 63 per cent less carbs," Harvey explains.&nbsp;</p><p>"So you can drink three pints for the price of one because you're saving 90 calories per pint.</p><p>"It means you can still enjoy yourself with no compromise. The taste is great, we've won awards for taste. We've just stripped out all of the unnecessaries."</p><p>The ethos behind Prime Time is about "being your best self you can be", says Harvey,</p><p>He adds: "One of the big things with Prime Time is giving back to the homeless.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"It goes with the ethos of being in your Prime, being your best self you can be - hence why we want to help those at the other extreme.</p><p>"Those who are not in their Prime and who need a helping hand and a step up in life."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-19-at-15.37.38.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/made-chelsea-harvey-armstrong-emily-796950880.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGphaYB5f5FwZqaZlJp6qrqMnJ%2BepKOarm60wKutnrFdpb%2BqucRmq6KllWKvprHRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
