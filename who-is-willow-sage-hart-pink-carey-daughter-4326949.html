Willow has teamed up with her famous mom to release an uplifting and original song, “Cover Me In Sunshine,” dropping this Friday, Feb. 11.

Since the song drops in just a few hours, get to know the rising talent behind the track:</p><h2><strong>1. Pink’s daughter has amazed fans with her singing voice.</strong></h2><a title=@pinkofficial href=# rel=nofollow>@pinkofficial</a><p id=content-paragraph-6>Cover me in 🌞</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><a title="♬ original sound - P!NK" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ original sound – P!NK</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>At just nine years old, Willow is already blowing away fans with her mature singing voice. On Feb. 10, Pink and Carey’s daughter made her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok debut</a> and sang a few lines from her new song “Cover Me In Sunshine.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“Cover me in sunshine / Shower me in good times / Tell me that the world’s been spinning since the beginning / And everything’ll be alright / Just cover me in sunshine,” Willow belted out with the expertise of a trained vocalist. Fans raved over the mini performance. “So vocals run in the family i see……,” one TikTok user commented, while another wrote, “we have another legend coming.”</p><h2><strong>2. Willow performed on ‘The Disney Holiday Singalong.’</strong></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Willow also showed off her singing skills&nbsp;during ABC’S airing of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Disney Holiday Singalong</a>&nbsp;in Nov. 2020. At the time, not many fans had been aware of Willow’s special talent, so viewers were stunned when the nine-year-old teamed up with her mom to sing <strong>Nat King Cole</strong>‘s “The Christmas Song.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>However, that was not the first time Willow did a duet with her mom. She made her recording debut on “A Million Dreams (Reprise)” from The Greatest Showman: Reimagined in 2018 (you can listen above).</p><h2><strong>3. She is also known for her punk rock hair.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>While Willow has picked up her mom’s musical skills, the young singing sensation got her punk rock flair from both her mom AND dad (he’s a famous BMX star, in case you didn’t know). Willow got a shaved mohawk <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hair makeover</a> in Sept. 2019, and is currently sporting a rock and roll-approved pixie cut.</p><h2><strong>4. Willow has a younger brother, who fell sick from COVID-19.</strong></h2><a title=@pinkofficial href=# rel=nofollow>@pinkofficial</a><p id=content-paragraph-16>This one is trouble</p><p id=content-paragraph-17><a title="♬ original sound - P!NK" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ original sound – P!NK</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Willow is the older sister of Pink and Carey’s four-year-old son, <strong>Jameson Moon Hart</strong>. He too made his singing debut on TikTok, which led many fans to tease that Willow’s adorable brother has a future in “metal” rock. While Jameson is healthy and rocking now, Pink revealed that he was “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>really sick</a>” amid a scary battle with COVID-19 in April of 2020. The “So What” singer fell ill with the virus too, which got so bad, she had to go on “nebulizers for the first time in 30 years” (Pink suffers from asthma). Fortunately, Willow and her dad, Carey, managed to stay healthy.</p><h2><strong>5. There is a special meaning behind Willow’s name.</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Pink-and-Willow-Sage-Hart-ap-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-20>Pink may be a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hollywood superstar</a>, but actually took inspiration from nature for her firstborn’s name. “The willow is my favorite tree. I grew up near one. It’s the most flexible tree in nature and nothing can break it — no wind, no elements. It can bend and withstand anything. I love that sentiment. I want that for her,” Pink told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>&nbsp;in Dec. 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“Sage is cleansing and sacred,” Pink continued. “And it sounded great together. It doesn’t hurt that her last name is Hart — flexible cleansed heart.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LEqrjLqK5mq5Gcsm60wKurZqiZo7hur8CrnLJllJbCqLTTnqlmbGNng3qAmGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
