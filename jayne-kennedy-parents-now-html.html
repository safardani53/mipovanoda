All thanks to her childhood dream of becoming a movie star.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Jayne Kennedy's Parents Supported Her&nbsp;</h2><p>Born to African-American parents — father&nbsp;Herbert Harrison and mother Virginia Harrison — in 1951,&nbsp;Kennedy <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dreamt big</a> from a young age. Her parents had taught&nbsp;her and her five siblings to aim high in life, believe in oneself, and be strong.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Courtesy of their parenting, Kennedy never hesitated to dream, though the world for Afro-Americans was comparatively more brutal. She aimed to be a movie star and indulged in conversations about Hollywood celebrities like Shirley Temple with her parents.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But after she was ten, she stopped mentioning that as her ambition for years. Instead, she got&nbsp;busy with cheerleading, partaking in the State&nbsp;Junior Olympics, and being the president of her class.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During her college days at the&nbsp;Girls State in Washington, D.C., she broke records, becoming the first black vice president at the annual conclave. And from then, her trailblazing journey started.</p><h2>Kennedy's Groundbreaking Career</h2><p>The multi-hyphenate became the first African American woman ever to be crowned Miss Ohio in 1970. She was 18&nbsp;at the time. The same year, she made history as the semi-finalist in the Miss USA pageant.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Following her groundbreaking success, the pageant queen moved to&nbsp;Los Angeles with her then-husband Leon Isaac Kennedy. Upon arriving in the city, she appeared in Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show as a product girl. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Then, the talented personality entered the Hollywood scene as a dancer and singer. She performed as a&nbsp;"Ding-a-Ling" girl for Dean Martin's television and roadshow for two years.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Her mesmerizing beauty that broke&nbsp;color barriers soon gained attention. And in 1972, she made her acting debut in Lady Sings the Blues. Again, Kennedy established herself as one of the hard-working artists, despite racist casting.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Her prominent acting projects include Wonder Woman,&nbsp;Benson, Police Story, and The Love Boat, among others.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 1978, the&nbsp;stunning actress broke all records yet again, becoming the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first black woman</a> to helm a&nbsp;sportscasting job. She started hosting CBS' The NFL Today. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During her tenure, she interviewed athletes like&nbsp;Julius Erving,&nbsp;Joe Namath, and even her friend,&nbsp;Mohammad Ali.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>With time,&nbsp;Kennedy broadened her career, adding modeling&nbsp;to the list. She became one of the first black women to be the cover face of&nbsp;Playboy&nbsp;Magazine in 1981.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>What happened to Jayne Kennedy?</h2><p>In late 1983,&nbsp;Kennedy got diagnosed with&nbsp;endometriosis, a long-term painful condition in the uterus. Meanwhile, the beauty queen was filming an exercise series titled&nbsp;Love Your Body.</p><p>In the light of the diagnosis, the legendary actress quit the show. Soon, she got pregnant with her first child, daughter Savannah Re, with her second husband, Bill Overton.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>To focus on her personal life and her kids, Kennedy retired from the entertainment industry. She had two more daughters&nbsp;—&nbsp;Kopper Joi&nbsp;and Zaire Ollyea&nbsp; — with&nbsp;her husband.</p><p>Though she is not working now, the 69-year-old actively takes part in humanitarian acts. She is an advocate for The Children’s Miracle Network, a non-profit organization.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRrrumecqepaedlK56sa3RnqWtq12jvLh6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
