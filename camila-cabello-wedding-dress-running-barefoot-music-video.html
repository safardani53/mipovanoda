The “Never Be the Same” singer, 22, was spotted sprinting barefoot through the streets of Los Angeles on August 12, looking disheveled in a white, wedding-style gown. Her hair is all mussed, and though the pics are a little blurry, it appears that she’s not wearing makeup.

And it’s practically perfect that she’s wearing what seems to be a wedding dress, considering her romance with new boyfriend <strong>Shawn Mendes</strong>, 21, is heating up. The couple have been on a PDA spree for the past month or so, not caring who takes their picture while they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>make out in the ocean</a>… or at his birthday party… or in front of their parents. Camila thinks Shawn’s her “real life Prince Charming” and she loves his wholesome vibes, a source close to the former Fifth Harmony singer told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>And she admitted that their relationship is intensifying in an interview with our <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sister outlet Variety</a> that “falling in love” makes her a better songwriter! “Falling in love is like an infinite amount of levels and layers and angles. I fell in love and just opened up. Everything was written in present moment,” Camila said of her new music. She didn’t name Shawn, but gushed about him while talking about their collaboration “Señorita”. “I’ve known Shawn for such a long time, and it’s so much fun getting to work and do things with somebody who means a lot to you,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/camila-cabello-runs-barefoot-through-l.a.-in-a-white-wedding-style-dress-for-new-music-video-embed-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/camila-cabello-runs-barefoot-through-l.a.-in-a-white-wedding-style-dress-for-new-music-video-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The pair haven’t verbally confirmed their relationship, and they may never. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>As a source told</a> <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY, “<span class=il>they</span>&nbsp;<span class=il>don</span>‘<span class=il>t</span>&nbsp;<span class=il>feel</span>&nbsp;<span class=il>they</span>&nbsp;have to make something official because&nbsp;<span class=il>they</span>&nbsp;consider themselves official already.&nbsp;<span class=il>They</span>&nbsp;are having fun and whatever people think&nbsp;<span class=il>their</span>&nbsp;relationship is not&nbsp;<span class=il>their</span>&nbsp;problem because&nbsp;<span class=il>they</span>&nbsp;know where&nbsp;<span class=il>they</span> stand and are having a great time together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH15e5BtZpyZnZ65onnCmpmepJykerixw52gp59dmb%2Bmv9Jmqa6mnp67qHnBmqmenp%2BkwW651KygnGWmnrGmu44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
