The invitation said,</p><p>“Ron’s birthday, July 30 at 10 p.m. on Seolleung Road, and participants must bring their own booze.”</p><p>The invitation was released on social media and sparked interest on the Korean internet months after her birthday. The post went viral when former entertainment reporter Lee Jin-ho addressed it on his YouTube channel.&nbsp;The invitation added to Kim Sae-already ron’s contentious year, which began with her arrest in May for driving under the influence of alcohol and slamming her vehicle into a transformer, inflicting property damage and generating a nuisance for everyone.

On November 5, the agency responded that it had no comment on the claims about the alcohol-themed celebration.&nbsp;For the uninitiated, Kim Sae-ron was driving under the influence of alcohol in the Gangnam neighborhood of Cheongdam on May 18 at approximately 8 a.m. KST when she collided with a transformer. She declined a breathalyzer and instead asked that the officers do a blood test to determine her blood alcohol concentration. She was arrested as a result of the event.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kim-Sae-Ron-1.jpg alt="Kim Sae Ron" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The next day, the Secret Healer actress issued an apologetic statement via her agency. She said that she would try her best to compensate for all of the damage caused by her drunk driving and that she will participate completely in the police inquiry.&nbsp;Kim Sae-ron also stepped aside from upcoming projects, including SBS drama Trolley, at her own request because she wanted to walk away from the spotlight and reflect on her conduct.</p><p>She also posted a handwritten apology on Instagram, apologizing for her conduct and accepting full responsibility. She also said that she is working on repenting and meditating on her conduct and that she would do so in due course.&nbsp;Various publications later reported that the actress had personally decided to accept responsibility for the accident’s damage and had settled the damage charges with the insurance company for causing damage to the property and livelihoods of all the local shop owners and flea market owners who were dependent on the electrical transformer she crashed into.</p><p>On June 4, Goldmedallist disclosed that the actress’s blood alcohol concentration was roughly 0.2 percent, a level high enough to have her driver’s license permanently revoked.&nbsp;They also indicated that the actress was profoundly sorry for her faults and was making amends for the harm she had caused and that she intended to accept full responsibility for her acts until the end. After a period of quiet, her agency disclosed on November 4 that she was working part-time at a nearby café owing to financial concerns.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kim-Sae-Ron-2.jpg alt="Kim Sae Ron" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Since the driving under the influence case, the actress has maintained a low profile in order to pay a substantial sum of compensation, settlement money, and advertising fines.&nbsp;Korean admirers, on the other hand, pointed out that she has been driving costly automobiles such as Bentley and Range Rover, and refused to trust her claims of being in financial trouble.&nbsp;In the middle of all of this, her viral birthday invitation to an alcohol-themed party has caused others to question her sincerity and self-reflection.</p><h2>Kim Sae-ron debuted in 2009.</h2><p>Kim Sae-ron began her acting career as a child actress on July 31, 2000.
