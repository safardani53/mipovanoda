Sunday marked her fourth Chiefs game of the season — and it seems her presence has helped Kelce’s performance on the field. <a href=#>CBS showed a graphic</a> during Sunday’s broadcast showing that Kelce gained 99 yards per game with Swift in the crowd versus 46.5 when he’s “left to his own devices,” a reference to her hit single “Anti-Hero.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Travis-Kelce-Proudly-Plays-Along-as-Fan-Calls-Him-Taylor-Swift-Boyfriend-at-Chiefs-Game.jpg><p>Chiefs coach <a href=#><strong>Andy Reid</strong></a> has also seen the improvement. “Kelce keeps getting better with time,” he told reporters on Sunday, teasing, “Taylor can stay around all she wants.”</p><p>Kelce first made his interest in Swift known in July, <a href=#>revealing on his “New Heights” podcast</a> that he attempted to meet Swift after one of her Eras Tour concerts at his team’s home stadium. He later invited her to <a href=#>see him “rock the stage”</a> — and the twosome have been going strong ever since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Travis-Kelce-Proudly-Plays-Along-as-Fan-Calls-Him-Taylor-Swift-Boyfriend-at-Chiefs-Game-3.jpg><p>“They’re really happy. They’re not saying they’re in love yet. But it’s obvious to her friends they’re heading in that direction,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly this month, adding that the pair have an ease to their relationship. “It’s going so well because it’s easy and nothing is complicated.”</p><p>According to the insider, Kelce is already <a href=#>planning to see Swift “when she’s back on tour”</a> for her international Eras dates starting in November. “And when she gets a break, she’ll see him,” the source told Us.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple were all smiles earlier this month when they <a href=#>stepped out for consecutive date nights</a> in New York City, including <a href=#>their surprise cameos</a> on the Saturday Night Live season 49 premiere. Swift is “really happy and excited” about where the romance is headed, per the source.</p><p>“She has butterflies in her stomach and she hasn’t had that in a while,” the insider told Us. “She feels safe and comfortable around him physically and emotionally.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ1dpbmixdJmmKWnnpx6or%2BMn5inZZOWua2%2FjKGgpmWklsatu9FmqrChlqnAbq7Osp2roZWjsXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
