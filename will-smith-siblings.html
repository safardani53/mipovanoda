After Will, the Smiths welcomed two more children: twins Harry and Ellen, who were born in 1971. All relatively close in age, the Smith siblings were able to grow up together and be there for each other, especially during their parents’ separation when Will was 13.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Will doesn’t frequently post photos with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>his siblings</u></a> on social media, he seems to have grown closer to his family during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2020 was a year of self-reflection and gratitude for the ones we love, and based on Will sharing more and more about his siblings, it looks like they may have reconnected during the quarantine.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Smith seems closest to his twin siblings, Harry and Ellen Smith.</h2><p>Both Harry and Ellen post frequently on their respective Instagrams, and they don't only post about their big brother Will, but also seem close to Will and Jada's children.
