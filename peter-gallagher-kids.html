The couple tied the knot on May 7, 1983, and recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrated 40 years of marriage</a>. Well, here's to 40 more!</p><p>On April 27, 1990, Peter and Paula welcomed their first child, James. Like his father, James works in the entertainment industry, but he prefers to be behind the camera. He's written and directed several short films, such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boy Leroy</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Love</a>.
