Can we expect him to be stopped or continue causing trouble?</strong></p><p><strong>Meredith: "</strong>Murdoc is a nemesis that never goes away ... I love him as a person, I mean the actor [David Dastmalchian], but in terms of his character he is a big nemesis and unfortunately we have not seen the last of Murdoc."</p><p><img align alt fid=517233 height hspace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/67/57/6efd649c410a11b3_murdoc_returns.jpg vspace width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Will Matty have even more badass moments this season?</strong></p><p><strong>Meredith: "</strong>I always love when Matty has badass moments, when she carries a gun and gets to boss people around. Some of my favorite scenes are interrogating people and getting right up in their faces. It's a lot of fun for me. We'll see a lot more "Matty Moments."</p><p><strong>What's your favorite behind-the-scenes moment on set?</strong></p><p><strong>Meredith: "</strong>One day, we should have a camera set up and just film us behind-the-scenes because some of the most hilarious moments emerge from our time just waiting to shoot. <a href=#>Lucas [Till]</a> is so hilarious and brings such levity to that set. As does <a href=#>Justin [Hires]</a>, and <a href=#>George [Eads]</a> is pretty hysterical, himself. There are always moments when we're just crying from laughing so hard."</p><p><img align alt fid=517232 height hspace src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage-us.pplusstatic.com/thumbnails/photos/files/asset/10/00/67/57/a4794f91923e6896_matti_moments.jpg vspace width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>What else do you and the cast do between takes?</strong></p><p><strong>Meredith: "</strong>We're all in our chairs, on our phones on <a href=#>Instagram</a> and <a href=#>Twitter</a>, or studying lines. I feel like that's all I do, my life is studying lines! We chitchat and go to craft services."</p><p><strong>So far in Season 2, what's been the most interesting scene to shoot?</strong></p><p><strong>Meredith: </strong>"One of my favorite scenes that Matty has in Season 2 is with Murdoc's son. There's a real poignant moment where she's talking to him, and Matty reveals part of her own past to his son. It's a really sweet scene between the two of them. That was really enjoyable."</p><p>Watch all-new episodes of <a href=#>MacGyver</a> on Fridays at 8/7c on CBS and <a href=#>CBS All Access.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa3RmqSorZ6pva3B0meaqKVfqLWww9JopJqbl67Dpr6Op5ywq19mfXGDlm1saKWVp7KltdOhZJ6ZpKS7brTArGStoJVivam7xKegsWWWpMKvsMCtoKimXZu2s7XNoGSopl2Wua15wrKjoqaUmr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
