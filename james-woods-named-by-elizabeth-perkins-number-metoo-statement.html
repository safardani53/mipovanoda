And the very latest, called out in a very public manner by actress Elizabeth Perkins, is none other than James Woods.</p><p>We wish that we could honestly say that we’re surprised … but we’re not.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/elizabeth-perkins-in-black-682x1024.jpg></p><p>Though it’s no shock to the system to hear James Woods named (more on that in a moment), no one expected his name to come out in quite the way that it did.</p><p>Elizabeth Perkins is a skilled, beautiful actress.</p><p>Though you may remember her as one of the stars of the ’90s&nbsp;Flintstones film, she is better known for her television work.</p><p>Most notably, she was one of the stars of Weeds. Her character’s arc was wild, but began with her courageously advocating for diet sodas to be included on school vending machines.</p><p>Since then, she’s had numerous television roles, including guest spots on The Closer and on How To Get Away With Murder.</p><p>Well, on Sunday, she made a very different sort of public appearance:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Elizabeth Perkins was one of the marchers at the Take Back The Workplace rally that took place in Hollywood on Sunday.</p><p>It’s a play on Take Back The Night, pointing out that plenty of women are sexually harassed or assaulted in the workplace or elsewhere by coworkers and bosses.</p><p>Plenty of people attend marches like this out of moral support, but it’s clearly a person matter for Elizabeth Perkins.</p><p>She carried a handwritten sign with her that displayed a very succinct message:</p><p>"James Woods&nbsp; #MeToo"</p><p>That simple sign is a pretty serious accusation against Woods.</p><p>Neither Elizabeth Perkins nor James Woods have immediately responded to requests for comments on it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/james-woods-speaks-827x1024.jpg><p>It’s no secret that James Woods is something of a conservative blowhard.</p><p>But the aging actor is known for more than just <a href=#>outrageously&nbsp;transphobic tweets</a> in which he implies that LGBT children will grow up to be serial killers.</p><p>Though … that alone is enough to tell you that James Woods is not a good person.</p><p>Back in September, <a href=#>James Woods attempted to bash a gay film</a> over the age difference of the (fictional) characters.</p><p>The relationship in Call Me By Your Name is a totally legal one, by the way. It seemed clear that James Woods was just having fun linking LGBT media to sexual predators, as many bigots like to pretend that sex with children is just the "next step" after LGBT rights.</p><p>Clearly, when James Woods tweeted the jab at the film, he didn’t expect for it to backfire in quite the way that it did.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/elizabeth-perkins-758x1024.jpg><p>Actress <a href=#>Amber Tamblyn&nbsp;penned an open letter to James Woods</a> and also tweeted about her run-in with him when she was only 16.</p><p>Long story short?</p><p>Amber Tamblyn accused James Woods of hitting on her and her friend when Amber herself was only 16.</p><p>You might think that he made an honest, if gross, mistake. Amber says that this was not the case:</p><p>"James Woods tried to pick me and my friend up at a restaurant once. He wanted to take us to Vegas. ‘I’m 16’ I said. ‘Even better’ he said."</p><p>Hitting on much younger women is something that a lot of old actors do.</p><p>It can be creepy, but so long as it’s within appropriate boundaries (not aggressive, not in a workplace, to name a few guidelines), it’s just standard flirtation.</p><p>Hitting on a real-life 16-year-old girl when you’re a grown-ass adult and then doubling down on it when she tells you that she’s a minor?</p><p>That is deeply disturbing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/james-woods-in-2017-772x1024.jpg><p>Some might joke that maybe Elizabeth Perkins isn’t James Woods’ type, because she’s old enough to vote.</p><p>But … that’s not actually funny.</p><p>And whenever James Woods does make a statement about Elizabeth Perkins’ accusation, we should note that "I allegedly prefer them barely legal" is the polar opposite of a believable defense.</p><p>A lot of sexual harassment doesn’t take the form of trying to date someone, by the way. And a lot of creeps and predators are fine with a whole spectrum of victims.</p><p>Besides, though Elizabeth Perkins has had a long career, the age gap between Elizabeth Perkins and James Woods is nearly old enough for Woods to allegedly try to take to Vegas.</p><a href=#><img width=1706 height=2560 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/weinstein-scandal-which-powerful-men-are-accused-of-sexual-misco-scaled.jpg alt="Hollywood Sex Scandal: Who's Been Caught?
