To complete the look, Xtina rocked pointy-toed heels, along with black devil ears. Her eye makeup was intense, with shadow caked onto the upper portion of her eyelids, as well as an intense, cat-eye eyeliner."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Her eye makeup was intense, with shadow caked onto the upper portion of her eyelids, as well as an intense, cat-eye eyeliner. Of course, there was dark black lipstick on her lips to complete the vampy look. She posed for one photo from the side, and one from behind, on her Instagram.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CHArGcsJaXc/</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>This wasn’t Christina’s only look of 2020, though! Her second costume was a sexy genie. For this ensemble, she wore another latex, Vex Clothing outfit — a jumpsuit — which featured long sleeves that led into gloved hands. She had jewels around her eyes, as well as a pop of red lipstick to match her outfit. Of course, she also held a genie’s lamp over her head as a prop to complete her sexy costume.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CHBOVkrJlDD/</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Finally, there was her alien costume, which was complete with another tight leather dress in black and silver. This time, her hair was totally slicked back, and her eyes were hidden behind tons of dark makeup around them. Once again, black lipstick was added to the dark, haunting look. Christina held up a fake gun to fight off any invaders, as well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CHB29itpFBD/</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Christina has admitted on social media that she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>loves Halloween</a>, and is often watching spooky Halloween-themed movies in her house. Even though the singer has two kids —&nbsp;<strong>Max</strong>, 12,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Summer</strong>, 6 — the holiday is clearly just as fun for her as it is for them. She gets a definite A-plus for her costumes this year!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ye49rZpygop7AtbXNmmSan6Weuaa%2BwGabnq6ZoXqprculprCdlaN6pLvSraymnV1nfXN8jKmfqKyfqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
