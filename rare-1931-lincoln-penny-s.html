The Lincoln penny first entered circulation in 1909, when it replaced the Indian head cent.
During the Lincoln cent’s more than a century-long run, there have been quite a few rare coins in the series including the VDB, 1992, and 1914 pennies.
Some of the designs of the Lincoln cent series include the memorial cent, union shield, and wheat ears.
When it comes to the value of coins, this is normally determined by low mintage, an error, or another unique element."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Lincoln cent in circulation, but they never found a 1931-S.”</p><p>If you happen to have a 1931 Lincoln coin in your possession, you’ll want to look under the “1931” on the obverse of the coin for a letter mark.&nbsp;</p><p>This will help you spot the difference and let you know if you have something that’s quite valuable.</p><h2><strong>How much is the 1932 Lincoln cent worth?</strong></h2><p>As always, the value of coins, in general, could vary by grade and condition.&nbsp;</p><p>For example,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Coin Book</a>&nbsp;pegs the value of the S coin at $102 in average condition and up to $215 if in an “uncirculated (MS-63)” grade.</p><p>Also, one recently&nbsp;<a href=#>sold online for $201</a>.</p><p>If you happen to find one with a “D” mark, it’s worth only $6.64 in average condition and up to $79 in a higher grade.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to find rare coins</strong></h2><p>An easy way to&nbsp;<a href=#>find rare coins</a>&nbsp;is by checking places in your home or any places you might store change.</p><p>You would be surprised what you might be able to find, as you’ll not only want to look for pennies but&nbsp;<a href=#>nickels</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>dimes</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>quarters</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>half dollars</a>&nbsp;as well.</p><p>Some other things you can try are using a metal detector in known areas for buried treasure and by stopping by your local bank branch and asking for a wrapper of pennies.</p><p>You can also try to get a good deal on one online through USA Coin Book or eBay.</p><p>But make sure you research the coin first and know what it’s worth before buying.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In other rare coin news, another Lincoln penny&nbsp;<a href=#>sold for $455</a>.</p><p>Also, a counterfeit Jefferson nickel&nbsp;<a href=#>sold for more than $400</a>.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>I found a rare silver Liberty coin in a roll - and it could be worth up to $XXX</span><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfaYJ1hI9tcGiqkaeybn2YbGhmpJmjsLC4zWannqaernq0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
