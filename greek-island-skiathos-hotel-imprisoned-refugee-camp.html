Rachel Royce is one of hundreds of Brits who were stranded in the Mediterranean as flights were cancelled due to the horrendous weather conditions.

Coming on holiday and feeling imprisoned in your hotel."</p><p>Concerned about her son's, Rachel went and visited one of them at another hotel, but then required help getting back to her own when attempting to leave.</p><p>A flash flood river had formed and cut off her route out of the hotel, but she spotted a fire engine pumping water and approached them for help.</p><p>However, local authorities have been strict on people leaving hotels and Rachel was left shocked at the response she got from a member of the fire brigade.</p><p>She said: “There was a fire engine outside desperately trying to pump water and I went to see them and ask if I could get across.</p><p>“But I was told off by one of them who said: 'You mustn't leave, this is an emergency, this is dangerous, you’re safe in the hotel'.”</p><p>“They were all really strict and angry with me. They were all raging.”</p><p>Rachel’s hotel managed to provide meals for everyone despite the conditions but it didn’t take long for supplies to get very low.</p><p>And conditions quickly began to worsen as the weather continued to wreak havoc across the island, with hotels feeling like “refugee camps”.</p><p>Rachel said: “There was no electricity or running water and toilets wouldn't flush.</p><p>“People were having to sleep in the lobby because their rooms were flooded.</p><p>“It was like a refugee camp for people who were meant to be having a nice holiday.</p><p>“There was no internet so nobody could contact anyone.</p><p>“People were worried about whether there was going to be any food or water.</p><p>“There was no electricity or flushing toilets so it wasn’t nice.”</p><p>Rachel eventually managed to get repatriation flights with Jet2.</p><p>However, she had to fork out a fortune when flying her son's out to the island with British Airways, after Jet2 cancelled their flights last week.</p><p>“This holiday has ended up costing me twice as much as it had in the first place. It’s been a disaster.</p><p>“I might have to take money out of my pension to cover this, it’s just been awful.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Last month, 500 flight cancellations as a result of an air traffic meltdown <a href=# aria-label="saw thousands of holidaymakers stranded at airports (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw thousands of holidaymakers stranded at airports </a>across the UK.</p><p>Families were forced to sleep on trolleys and airport floors due to the impact of the <a href=# aria-label="Majorca (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Majorca </a>storms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/skiathos-floods-rachel-joyce-843161349.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2020-found-fist-sized-bag-843153080.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/04bbb2fb-59ed-4595-822b-a5fa23b7db09.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2020-found-fist-sized-bag-843153038-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2020-found-fist-sized-bag-843153033.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2020-found-fist-sized-bag-843153075.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4B5gZZtaW1nl6eypreMoqqlmZ6ZerS3yJqroaejYrWwwMSlZKKloKe2tLvNnptmqpWbwqixxGaamqWgZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
