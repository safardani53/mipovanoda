Fans also met the show's villain, The Darkling (played by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ben Barnes</a>), as well as a slew of other memorable characters, including The Crows, a misfit gang of criminals tasked with kidnapping Alina.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The show quickly took the No. 1 spot on the streaming giant's Top 10 list, and fans of the books were clearly satisfied with the adaption. Season 1 ended on a major cliffhanger, leaving plenty of room for new challenges and storylines for Alina and her friends in the upcoming season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The most wonderful thing about Season 2 is that we get to advance the story of these characters that we'd left in precarious positions at the end of Season 1. There's a lot of potential for them this season," showrunner Eric Heisserer told Netflix's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Tudum</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for everything there is to know about Shadow and Bone season 2.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-shadow-and-bone-season-2-about></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>What is </strong><strong>Shadow and Bone</strong><strong> season 2 about?</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dávid Lukács/Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In season 1, after discovering her sun-summoning powers, Alina is thrust into magical training and tasked with destroying the Shadow Fold — a region of darkness that splits the country of Ravka and is home to deadly monsters. While she was not able to take down the Fold, Alina and her friends do manage to escape its perils and defeat The Darkling, or so they thought. The final scene shows Barnes' character emerging from the Fold stronger than ever and with an army of monsters in his command.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Picking up from this ending, season 2 is sure to be a wild one, and Alina and The Darkling are presumably heading toward another showdown. There also seems to be more romance brewing between Alina and her childhood best friend Malyen "Mal" Oretsev (played by Archie Renaux).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In exclusive season 2 photos shared by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>, the will-they-won't-they couple is pictured holding hands. "They're certainly not in the same place as they were in season 1," Heisserer told EW. "They've made some pretty big decisions together that they soon discover means they're all or nothing, and that puts a lot of stress on each other. I, too, am worried for them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Heisserer also confirmed that the upcoming season will draw on "multiple books" in the Grishaverse, including the sequel in the flagship series, Siege and Storm, and the final book, Ruin and Rising.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like with the first season, season 2 will pull from Bardugo's Six of Crows series as well, and viewers will get to see the members of The Crows get up to some new trouble.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-there-a-trailer-for-shadow-and-bone-season-2></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Is there a trailer for Shadow and Bone season 2?</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Netflix released an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>official trailer</a> for Shadow and Bone season 2 on Feb. 17, 2023. The nearly three-minute teaser shows Alina on the quest to destroy The Darkling and his "unkillable army made of shadows" by finding two mythical creatures that will amplify her powers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to the trailer's release, fans got a sneak peek of season 2 on Valentine's Day. The streamer shared a short clip from the upcoming season on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Twitter</a>, writing, "A Villain-tine's Day love letter from me to you: Here's a sneak peek at The Darkling in Shadow and Bone Season 2!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the clip, Barnes' character appears (looking as villainous as ever) and announces, "I have returned, and I've made some new friends." The next shot shows two towering, shadowy monsters standing behind him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Netflix also released <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a teaser trailer</a> in September 2022 during Tudum: A Netflix Global Fan Event. The action-packed sneak peek shows a more self-assured Alina coming into her powers as she proclaims, "I am the sun summoner." It also features a steamy kiss between her and Mal as well as tons of fight scenes and an ominous message from The Darkling, with Barnes saying, "Are you willing to sacrifice that which is most precious to you?"</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-is-in-the-cast></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Who is in the cast?</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The entire cast of Shadow and Bone will be returning in season 2 to reprise their roles.

It can be far more than three seasons because Leigh's just written so many books and there's a lot of ground for us to cover," Heisserer told the outlet. "I feel like this is going to remain strong and healthy even at four seasons and beyond that, who knows? But I feel very nervous talking about that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Netflix announced that Shadow and Bone had been renewed for season 2, Bardugo said in a statement, per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Collider</a>, "I've been writing in the Grishaverse for nearly ten years now, so I'm thrilled we get to keep this adventure going. There are so many places we've barely gotten to visit and I can't wait to introduce our audience to more of the saints, soldiers, thugs, thieves, princes, and privateers who make this world so much fun to explore.
