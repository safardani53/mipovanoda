He believes in fairytale love and finding his Prince Charming. But this season's new lead, tech exec Charlie Winshaw, only came on the show to salvage his career and can barely form a sentence around his suitors. Dev agrees to help Charlie practice his dating skills offscreen so that Charlie can stand a chance at finding love — or at the very least, fake it for Ever After's ratings. Both men address mental health issues along the way and Dev ends up doing his job almost too well, as Charlie has a major realization that turns his journey into truly the most dramatic season yet. Two people do end up falling in love, just not the two Dev or Charlie expected when the season started.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dating-dr-dil-by-nisha-sharma></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>'Dating Dr. Dil' by Nisha Sharma</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>courtesy amazon</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kareena Mann's dad offers her a deal: secure a fiancé in four months, and he'll let her have her mother's house rather than put it on the market. But Kareena has no interest in dating and her prospects only plummet when her argument with Dr. Prem Verma, host of The Dr. Dil Show, goes viral. Meanwhile, Prem's potential donors for the clinic he wants to build vanish in the wake of his online controversy. So Kareena's overbearing aunties make him an offer: They'll give him the money for his clinic if he can get Kareena to believe they're meant to be together.

Ryan realizes he could use Lindsay's help, though, to prep for a celebrity baking show he'll be appearing on, and Lindsay reluctantly agrees to give him lessons. As Ryan's baking abilities improve, his relationship with Lindsay heats up outside of the kitchen, too.
