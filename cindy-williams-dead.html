A biography on the website also reflected on Cindy’s life, including her successful work in the acting world, which included not only television, but theater productions and films as well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Cindy’s passing comes just <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>four years after</a> the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>passing of her co-star <strong>Penny Marshall</strong></a>, who played the epic role of Laverne in Laverne & Shirley. The show, which was a spinoff of Happy Days, became a much loved sitcom and told the story of two friends/roommates who worked as bottle-cappers in the fictional Shotz Brewery in the 1950s. It aired from 1976 until 1983.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cindy-williams-laverne-and-shirley-ev-2embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>In 2013, Penny and Cindy reunited for an appearance in an episode of the television series Sam & Cat. In the last few years of her life, Cindy also published a memoir called Shirley, I Jest!, which was published in 2015. She also took part in celebrity branding for<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Visiting Angels</a>, a senior citizen service that homes and assists the elderly. Cindy was not married at the time of her death and is survived by her two children, Zak and Emily, who she shared with ex-husband <strong>Bill Hudson</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ye5JpZpyhnpnGbsPIpaOimZ2oeqWxwJ1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
