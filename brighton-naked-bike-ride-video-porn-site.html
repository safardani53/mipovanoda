and that cycling is the most efficient form of human powered transport ever invented.</p><p>"The movement also promotes improved awareness of cyclists by motorists towards making cycling the safe alternative.</p><p>"As part of raising awareness, the movement also supports the expression of freedom exemplified by the right to be naked in public, in a way that is non-threatening and raises the public profile of the annual protests all around the world.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">read more on the sun</h2></p><p>"The Brighton Naked Bike Ride is organised by a collective and we are planning to be running again in 2022."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The event launched in June 2006 and organisers say it has "brought a heady mix of fearless frivolity, freedom of expression and eco-politics onto the streets of Brighton".</p><p>Following negotiations with Sussex Police, participants were given permission to go "fully nude or as bare as you dare".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000412322520.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000412511564.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000412511326.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000412366393.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Hundreds of naked cyclists hit the saddle for Brighton’s annual nudist bike ride</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoRzfpVva2tnkqe2qLTTqKVmppGgsqV5waKinmWinrGmedWim56nXaW8s7qMrKCtnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
