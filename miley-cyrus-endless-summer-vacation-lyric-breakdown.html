“When it comes to the sequencing of Endless Summer Vacation, I divided it by two parts: a.m. and p.m. to almost represent an act,” Cyrus, 30, said in a video posted via Twitter on Monday, March 6. “The a.m. to me is representing the morning time where there’s a buzz and an energy and a potential of new possibilities."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s a new day.”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “And in the nighttime, it feels like there’s a slinky, seediness and kind of a grime but a glamour at the same time. In the evening, it’s a great time for rest [and] it’s a time to recover or it’s a time to go out and experience the wild side.”</p><p class=p1>The “Wrecking Ball” singer — who compared the vibe of&nbsp;<i>Endless Summer Vacation</i>&nbsp;to&nbsp;Los Angeles’ nightlife— <a href=#>dropped her LP on Friday, March 10</a>. The album, which<a href=#> also includes hit single “Flowers,”</a> takes fans on a journey of a failed relationship. Many fans were quick to point out possible clues to her whirlwind marriage to <a href=#><strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“And you smell like perfume that I didn’t purchase /&nbsp;Now I know why you’ve been closing the curtains,” Cyrus sings in “Muddy Feet,” adding, “Get the f–k out of my house.”</p><p class=p1>Some listeners took to Twitter, alleging that the Disney Channel alum — who h<a href=#>as not shared the inspiration behind the song</a> — is accusing ex-husband Hemsworth, 33, of infidelity.</p><p class=p1>Cyrus and the <i>Witcher&nbsp;</i>star <a href=#>dated on and off after meeting on the set of 2010’s&nbsp;<i>The Last Song</i></a>. The&nbsp;<i>Hunger Games&nbsp;</i>actor proposed in June 2012 before they split again one year later. The twosome ultimately reunited in January 2016 and <a href=#>tied the knot in December 2018.</a> After less than one year of marriage, the pair called it quits. As the former couple — <a href=#>whose divorce was finalized in January 2020</a> — announced their breakup, rumors swirled that <a href=#>cheating was the reason behind their decision</a> to separate.</p><p class=p1>“Once Liam & I reconciled, I meant it, & I was committed. There are NO secrets to uncover here,” the&nbsp;<i>Hannah Montana&nbsp;</i>alum&nbsp;— who is <a href=#>currently dating drummer <strong>Maxx Morando</strong></a> — <a href=#>tweeted</a> in August 2019, denying the claims. “I’ve learned from every experience in my life. I’m not perfect, I don’t want to be, it’s boring. I’ve grown up in front of you, but the bottom line is, I HAVE GROWN UP.”</p><p class=p1>She continued at the time: “I can admit to a lot of things but I refuse to admit that my marriage ended because of cheating. Liam and I have been together for a decade. I’ve said it before & it remains true, I love Liam and always will.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The Australia native, who <a href=#>has since moved on with <strong>Gabriella Brooks</strong></a>, has never publicly addressed the cheating allegations.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below for a complete breakdown of Cyrus’&nbsp;<i>Endless Summer Vacation&nbsp;</i>lyrics:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bitq2x2GaasqqlqHqmusOlnKyrXajCrrnEq2SvmZOWwaq7zWajsqqZmHqjvsSaop2np6N8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
