To start, you'll want to get a string of LED lights. Most of the examples on TikTok right now use strips of the color-changing LED ones, but others have also used strands of Christmas lights. LED lights tend to work better, though, as they don't get as hot as other options and therefore are less of a fire hazard.</p><p>You'll also need some synthetic stuffing, like you would use to stuff pillows or plushies, as well as either cardboard or craft paper to stick your project to. Of course, if you are OK with gluing stuffing to your wall, you won't need the cardboard or craft paper, but we don't recommend that if you rent your current living space.</p><p>All of these materials can easily be found on Amazon, though you can also find the stuffing and cardboard at your local craft store.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>To get started, you can either attach the cardboard or craft paper to the wall space you're looking to fill or hang it when you're done. Place the lights on the cardboard first. Most examples make a zig-zag pattern or use shorter strips of LED lights to break it up. Wherever you place the lights is what portion of the clouds will light up, so do this mindfully.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Then, using a hot glue gun (or another adhesive method), glue the stuffing to the cardboard. This may take some practice, but the best method is to glue on the cardboard and then hold a clump of stuffing in place until it sticks.</p><p>Mess with it until you have the general shape you want, and then attach it to your wall and you're done! It's that simple.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Be sure to regularly check your walls for bugs.</h2><p>One of the recurring downsides to this DIY, that many TikTok users point out in the comments of these videos, is that a wall of stuffing is easy breeding ground for spiders and other creepy crawlies. If you're OK with bugs, this might not be a problem, but if you find yourself with an increasing number of bugs after doing this project, it might be worth it to get rid of the wall.</p><p>That being said, if done right, this project creates a wildly aesthetic room decor option.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLmwwcNmrpqknGLBqrfTqKI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
