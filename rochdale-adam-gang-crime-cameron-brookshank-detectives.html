But he was attacked with an axe - severing his hand and puncturing his lung in a near-fatal attack.
The brave teen, left with life-changing injuries and trauma, was the innocent victim of a brutal organised crime gang (OCG) with an iron grip on the town.
His case, featured in the current series of The Detectives: Taking Down an OCG on BBC2 and IPlayer, highlights a wider problem of growing gang warfare which is terrorising the residents of the Greater Manchester district."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

As I turned around I saw the axe was about here [gesturing to the side of his head] and I put my arm up.</p><p>“The axe went through the top of my wrist and then it shattered my bone. I remember absolutely every single second of that day.”</p><p>Cameron was airlifted to hospital for life-saving surgery and underwent five surgeries to maintain 60 per cent use of his arm.</p><p>As well as the physical and mental scars he suffered, he had to deal with the prospect of intimidation from the violent gang. His dad told the programme he had felt safe, thinking they didn’t know his address, until they approached one of Cameron’s colleagues.</p><p>“They told him if we went to court, there'd be serious consequences,” he says, adding they offered a £10,000 bribe. “The terror, knowing what they are capable of…”.</p><p>But Cameron refused to waver, saying: “I didn’t show any weakness on the day, I’m not going to show any weakness in January.”&nbsp;</p><p>Skinny was convicted of assault and was jailed for 18 years, in 2019.</p><p>At the end of the three-parter, it was revealed that <a href=#>Cameron died this year</a> - his cause of death was not disclosed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/6bc20c90-4c7d-4dec-b2e8-8208338c8d29.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NINTCHDBPICT000856498225.jpg><h2>Child trafficking</h2><p>While the OCG team are keen to crack down on the violence, the gang’s phones, seized during arrests for the attack, reveal a new low - as pictures of kids as young as 11 being groomed to deal heroin crack are found.</p><p>The new evidence prompted the team to launch an investigation into child exploitation, which identified at least 40 kids who were being forced to run drugs.</p><p>One 12-year-old recruit calmly explains the difference between crack and heroin and says he knew because he “watched him bagging up.”</p><p>A 13-year-old reveals a network of underage dealers, saying he was asked to sell “weed or cocaine” and adding if he didn’t: “It’s not just them, there’s a load of people that could come after me.”</p><p>Masood Ahmed, who runs Newborn General Store, told us: "My customers just complain that very young children sell drugs. There's a lot of drugs being sold here."</p><p>He's installed special protective glass over the shop's front door to prevent robbers from smashing into it.</p><p>Mr Ahmed said: "We've had robberies but generally the violence is between the gangs."</p><p>Violence remains a problem in the area, with one middle-aged dad, who did not want to be named, telling us he witnessed a horrifying attack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/VP-GANGS_PIC-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/newbald-estate-rochdale-machette-attack-856525135.jpg><p>He said: Things are always bubbling under the service and the gangs mainly target each other.</p><p>"I did see a machete attack once where one man's face was almost sliced off. It was sickening."</p><p>Some locals suggest things have improved due to an increased police presence and those who spot potential gang members avoid getting in their way.</p><p>Mum-of-two Valerie Hoyle, 75, said: "We had grooming gangs here targeting young girls.</p><p>"But I've seen gangs of kids armed with machetes. You just stay out of their way."</p><p>One street cleaner told us the area was "fairly quite during the day" before adding: "But you don't want to be wandering around at night."</p><h2>Cuckooing and kid dealers</h2><p>While the ADAM OCG has a grip on the town, they are not the only gangs to cause terror in the area.</p><p>In 2018,&nbsp; Superintendent John-Paul Ruffle said 12 major gangs operate in Rochdale, which has the second highest rate of organised crime in Greater Manchester.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year nine members of the 706 - who also called themselves the Portuguese Mafia (PMG) - were jailed after terrorising two estates in the town.</p><p>The gang peddled cocaine, heroin and cannabis, using threats of violence to instill fear.</p><p>They also ‘Cuckooed’ vulnerable addicts - moving into their homes and using them as a criminal base - with one victim telling the court: "I wanted my home to be my chance to sort my life out. This opportunity was destroyed the second this group decided to take over my flat."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/adam-gang-rochdale-snap-wads-856498351-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/6e2e3bff-ea31-412f-a6a5-c0eadbb3071a.jpg><p>Many residents had to be moved into different areas during the investigation for protection.</p><p>In June 2022, nine members of the gang were jailed for drug offences.</p><h2>Gang warfare</h2><p>The PMG also had a running feud with local gang the M40, also known as the Lane Boys.</p><p>On Bonfire Night, 2020, the beef exploded when M40 member <a href=#>Alexander John Soyoye</a> was cornered by rival gang members and stabbed and beaten to death.</p><p>Within hours, the M40 plotted to avenge his death targeting the PMG members they believed responsible, but the plot was foiled by the arrest of member Harry Oni, with police finding messages about the plan on his phone, along with incriminating evidence about previous attacks.</p><p>In June 2022, 10 gang members were sentenced to a total of 131 years, with four convicted of conspiracy to murder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/7pm-thursday-5-november-officers-618779359-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/adam-gang-rochdale-856500899-1.jpg><p>Preston Crown Court was told that the 10 defendants – all of Manchester – were all members of a gang called the ‘M40’ or ‘40’, named after the postcode of the area in which the gang originated.
