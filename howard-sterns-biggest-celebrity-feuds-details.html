“I personally wish that he had never run. I told him that,” Stern said on his show in February 2017. “Because I actually think this is something that is going to be very detrimental to his mental health, too. Because he wants to be liked, he wants to be loved, he wants people to cheer for him."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I told him that,” Stern said <a href=#>on his show</a> in February 2017. “Because I actually think this is something that is going to be very detrimental to his mental health, too. Because he wants to be liked, he wants to be loved, he wants people to cheer for him. I don’t think this is going to be a healthy experience for him.”&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, Stern revealed he was upset that the former Apprentice star never called him for advice while in office and revealed <a href=#>what he would say to him</a>. “My advice would be, like, get the f–k out of there, man,” he retorted. “[What] do you need that for? Go back to Mar-a-Lago and hang.”&nbsp;</p><p>Following the 2020 election, Stern has continued to speak negatively about Trump on his SiriusXM show and even threw out the idea of running for president himself in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>In January 2023, Trump took to his social media platform, <a href=#>Truth Social</a>, to take a dig at his old pal. “I have been noticing the fact that Howard Stern's show has gone to Hell, and so few people are listening — Used to be great, now it rates less than fair. It's a sad thing to watch,” the former reality star wrote. “When he loved ‘Trump,’ it was ‘hot,’ when he decided to go with Crooked Hillary, his ratings world collapsed. Can't believe they pay him so much money, but I hope he gets it!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktbDDwKubZqukmr%2Bvv4yboKCflajBbq%2FEpZybqpmpxm6yxK6brGWUmsGitcusZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
