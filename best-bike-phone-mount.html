A bike phone mount might be the answer for you, allowing you to transform your smartphone into an all-singing, all-dancing head unit for a much smaller cost.
Not only does a smartphone have all the features you could want from an entry-level GPS unit, including maps and the ability to display live stats through a third-party app such as Strava, but it can also be used to make calls, send texts and post the obligatory mid-ride selfie on social media."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You’ll have to make sure that they’re compatible with your smartphone handset too.</p><p>Want to turn your smartphone into a bike GPS with the help of a phone holder? Read on below to see our pick of the best bike phone mounts on the market.</p><h2>1. SP Connect Bike Bundle II</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ftp_f_freewheel_imagesmadisonfwaccessoriesga001517.jpg><ul><li><strong>SP Connect Bike Bundle II, £54.99 at Freewheel - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>We were looking for a new phone mount for our bike and we got our hands on the SP Connect Bike Bundle II for a test cycle or three.</p><p>A few weeks later and we're so pleased with its performance we have no plans to remove it from our handlebars.</p><p>The universal clip that attaches to your bike frame would easily grip a variety of shapes and sizes, so it seems unlikely that you wouldn't be able to get it on the vast majority of bikes.</p><p>You will have to spend a little bit more on the SP Connect Bundle because it includes a fitted case for whatever phone you have.</p><p>But that ensures your phone will remain secure and protected whatever your throw at it.</p><p>The cases are decent too, and we had no problem leaving ours attached to our phone when it wasn't attached to our bike.</p><p>As an added perk, the cases work with SP's other mounts, including running arm bands and a car mounts which can attach to your windscreen or your air vents.</p><p>In all, this bike mount is easy to attach and adjust, and it holds your phone securely in place whether you want it horizontal or vertical.</p><p>There's cheaper models out there, but the SP bundle is up there with the most stylish and we couldn't fault its performance.</p><h2><strong>2. Triban 900 M Waterproof Bike Smartphone Holder</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-7-e1592572791347.jpg><ul><li><strong>Triban 900 Waterproof Smartphone holder, £17.99 from Decathlon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>A caddy system is generally the cheapest way of getting the most out of your phone when on the move, and the 900 Waterproof Smartphone holder from Decathlon's in-house brand Triban is a great entry-level offering.</p><p>The weatherproof holder comes in two sizes – medium and large – and the latter of the two can take even the biggest smartphone and allows you to carry on using the screen thanks to a clear screen cover.</p><p>The holder clips to your stem or handlebar using a tool-free mount, and it is possible to ride with the caddy in either a portrait and landscape orientation.</p><h2><strong>3. SKS Smartboy Handlebar Mount</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/po2.jpg><ul><li><strong>Smartboy Handlebar Mount, £26.99 from Tredz - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The Smartboy Handlebar Mount from German brand SKS is similar in design to the Triban offering, but the mount is attached using hex bolts and should therefore be slightly more secure.</p><p>It also has a transparent touch window, allowing you to operate your smartphone while it’s strapped to your bike’s handlebars or stem.</p><p>But, like the above, it doesn’t feature a window in the rear to take a picture from, meaning your phone will have to be removed from the sleeve if you want to take a snap.</p><p>The Smartboy can also fit a range of smartphones, while SKS even offers a five-year warranty.</p><h2><strong>4. Lezyne Smart Energy Caddy</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/po3.jpg><ul><li><strong>Smart Energy Caddy, £21.99 from Tredz - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The Smart Energy Caddy from Lezyne merges a phone case with a small crossbar bag, allowing you to view your phone’s display while also carrying essentials like gels, <a href=#>multi-tools</a> and valuables in a secondary pouch.</p><p>The bag is secured to your bike’s stem and top tube using three Velcro strips, which should keep things in place while riding.</p><p>It also makes removing the caddy when not in use a quick and easy procedure.</p><p>It can fit phones between 4-5” in size, meaning it should fit all but the largest handsets, while its weatherproof design should keep your phone safe even in a downpour.</p><h2><strong>5. Quad Lock Bike mount</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/po4.jpg><ul><li><strong>Bike mount, from £22.95 from Quad Lock - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The Quad Lock is a clever piece of kit that attaches your smartphone to your bike’s handlebars or stem using a specially designed phone case and mount set-up.</p><p>It allows your smartphone to be securely attached to your bike using a double-locking system, ensuring it can’t fall off mid-ride, regardless of the terrain. It also keeps all of the features of your smartphone, such as the camera, uncovered, meaning taking a picture while out on your bike is as easy as unclipping the lock.</p><p>The system is available in iPhone or Samsung Galaxy-specific cases, or with a universal mount.</p><h2><strong>6. Topeak Weatherproof Ridecase</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/po5.jpg><ul><li><strong>Weatherproof Ridecase, £44.99 from Wiggle - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Like Quad Lock’s offering, the Weatherproof Ridecase from cycling accessories specialist Topeak is designed like a phone case that your phone is clipped into.</p><p>It can be attached to your bike in a range of places, including your handlebars, stem or even the stem cap (if your bike has one), with the mounts included in the box.</p><p>The case is able to handle even the worst conditions that you’re likely to encounter when out on the bike, while it’s still possible to use a touchscreen and the rear camera when your phone is clipped in.</p><p>The only negative is that it is limited to Apple iPhone 6/6s and 6 Plus/6s Plus handsets.</p><h2>7. Syosin Universal Bike Phone Holder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/71F6WBY41iL._AC_SL1500_.jpg><ul><li><strong>Syosin Universal Bike Phone Holder, £15.99 from Amazon - <a href=#>buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>One smartphone bike mount that doesn't have a similar compatibility issue is this universal offering from Syosin.</p><p>The elasticated cover can stretch to your phone, and is compatible with most modern devices that have screens between 4"-6.5".</p><p>What's more, the bands won't cover any front-facing cameras or fingerprint sensors, leaving your smartphone fully functional, even when it's in the case.</p><p>Unlike the caddy system offerings above, the phone holder isn't waterproof but is perfect for fair-weather cyclists.</p><p>Finally, its tool-free installation and 360° rotation design make it an adaptable piece of kit ideal for cycling, but also for attaching to other things such as a child's buggy or a treadmill.</p><h2>Is a cycle computer better than my phone?</h2><p>For most recreational cyclists, a smartphone is the only tool you need to plan, navigate, and track your rides. However, if you're taking your cycling up a gear and looking for increased accuracy or better turn-by-turn directions, a cycling computer could be a worthwhile investment.</p><p>The entry-level <a href=#>Cateye Velo Wireless</a> is a good place to start if you just want to be able to clearly see your cycling stats when riding. At the other end of the spectrum lies the likes of the <a href=#>Garmin 830</a> and <a href=#>Wahoo Elemnt Roam</a>, which include features such as training plans, detailed maps and all-day battery life.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE FROM SUN SELECTS HEALTH AND FITNESS</h2></p><p>Enjoyed our roundup of the best bike phone mounts?
