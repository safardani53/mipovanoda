Duggar family without mentioning the very particular set of religious beliefs and customs that dominate most of their waking hours.</p><p>The family’s ultra-conservative views have been a top focal point for both fans and critics, with the former praising the Duggars for their piety, and the latter condemning them for their archaic views.</p><p>The Duggars have their religion to thank for their continued fame, but it’s also been the source of some of their most damaging scandals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Almost two-thirds of Americans identify as Christians, but very few of them would feel at home in one of the Duggars’ church services.</p><p>Even fellow believers in the Duggars’ minuscule sect would likely balk at the prospect of raising their children as strictly as Jim Bob and Michelle have.</p><p>Their probable reasons for granting their own kids a longer leash would be fully supported by the Duggars’ current set of circumstances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It stands to reason that if you use your faith to justify controlling every aspect of your children’s lives, they’re far more likely to rebel at the first opportunity.</p><p>And that’s exactly how the Duggars wound up in their current crisis — one that’s created an endless string of tabloid-friendly controversies and some deep divisions between parents and kids.</p><p>But before we attempt to determine whether any of the Duggar children have gone so far as to leave the church, we have to answer a more fundamental question.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Namely — <a href=#>what religion are the Duggars</a>?</p><p>The answer is not as simple as you might think.</p><p>The Duggars are Independent Baptists — a fairly sizable sect that comprises roughly 2.5 percent of the US population, according to a study by the Pew Research Center.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Independent Baptists have a long history of far-right conservatism, having been founded by a small contingent who felt that more mainstream Baptist sects were becoming too liberal.</p><p>The Duggars, however, didn’t feel that the IB branch is conservative or insular enough on its own.</p><p>And so, they joined the <a href=#>Quiverfull movement</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The brainchild of Institute for Basic Life Principles founder Bill Gothard, the Quiverfull movement lost most of its members when Gothard was forced to step down amid a string of sex scandals.</p><p>But Jim Bob and Michelle have remained faithful members — and so, it seems, have most of their kids.</p><p>The IBLP and the Quiverfull movement teach that it’s the duty of every Christian woman to give birth to as many children as possible.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Duggar Family: How Their Bizarre Religious Beliefs Created a Monster Like Josh</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>That’s why there’s pretty much always a pregnant Duggar.</p><p>Just this week, we learned that <a href=#>Jessa Duggar is expecting her fourth child</a>.</p><p>At just 28 years old, Jessa seems to be planning on raising a double-digit-sized brood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So it’s safe to assume that she’s still a believer in both the IBLP and the teachings of the disgraced Bill Gothard.</p><p>Her older sister, however, seems to have chosen a very different path.</p><p>Jill Duggar is no longer on speaking terms with her parents, and she seems to have little interest in following their belief system.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In recent months we learned that <a href=#>Jill drinks alcohol</a> and uses birth control, both of which are major no-nos in the Duggars’ world.</p><p>She almost certainly practices some sort of evanglical faith, but odds are, she’s abandoned the Quiverfull movement and no longer attends services at an Independent Baptist church.</p><p>The other most likely candidate for defection is Jinger Duggar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jinger lives in Los Angeles with her husband, Jeremy Vuolo, who is currently studying at a local divinity school.</p><p>The Vuolos are Baptists, but they’ve abandoned many of the rules that define the Quiverfull lifestyle, including the one that requires women to wear long skirts at all times.</p><p>So Jinger has forged her own path (with the permission of her husband), but it currently looks as though she and Jill are currently the family’s only rebels.</p><p>We can only hope that some of their siblings will see the light as they gain more experience of the world.</p><ul
