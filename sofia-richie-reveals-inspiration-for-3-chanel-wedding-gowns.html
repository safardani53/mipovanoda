“I always had this vision of the big princess dress, and going big, but as I got older, I realized that I wanted something a bit more simple,” the model, 24, told Vogue in an interview published on Saturday, April 22, after her ceremony concluded. “Maybe ‘simple’ isn’t the right word because my dress definitely is not simple!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I honestly think Elliot is going to love it. He is my biggest cheerleader when it comes to anything I wear. If he doesn’t cry, I’ll be very sad.”</p><p class=p1>Sofia’s ceremony look also included several personal touches, including an embroidered “S&E 4.22.23”&nbsp; sewn on the inside with blue thread — to<a href=#> be her “something blue”</a> on Saturday. The NudeStix beauty director’s bridal gown featured beaded hearts on the bodice, as well.</p><p class=p1>“We also loved the heart design in the middle of my chest and my ribs,” Sofia told the outlet, noting that she liked that the two hearts faced one another, which <a href=#>she compared to her relationship with Grainge</a>. “I am so excited. [It’s] because I’m marrying Elliot, I know that sounds cheesy — but he is the man of my dreams.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sofia-richie-collaborated-with-chanel-for-her-3-custom-wedding-gowns-i-feel-like-a-princess-01.jpg><p class=p1>In addition to her traditional ceremony dress, Sofia collaborated with the atelier to make unique pieces for both her rehearsal dinner and wedding reception. For the former, Sofia was drawn to a high-necked, long-sleeved beaded dress.</p><p class=p1>“It’s absolutely perfect. I’m scared to move because I don’t want to ruin one bead,” the fashion designer gushed of the gown she wore to the Friday, April 21, occasion. “This is like a fairy tale. It really is. It’s like an art piece. I feel like a princess, I really do!”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “I really wanted to bring a sparkly elegant perspective with this dress. Obviously, there’s a lot going on with the beading, and my hair will probably get tangled if we leave it down so we’re thinking [of an updo] so we can show off the neck and detailing. I’m keeping the makeup for the entire weekend super simple and clean. I just want it to feel timeless: I don’t want to look back in like 20 years and be like, ‘She’s a glamazon.’”</p><p class=p1>Sofia <a href=#>walked down the aisle on Saturday</a> with dad Lionel, 73, before she exchanged vows with her now-husband outside the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, France. Several of the Richies’ famous friends attended, including Sofia’s big sister <a href=#><strong>Nicole Richie</strong></a> — whom Lionel and first ex-wife <strong>Brenda Harvey</strong> a<a href=#>dopted when she was 9 years old</a> — and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Joel Madden</strong></a>. <a href=#><strong>Paris Hilton</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Carter Reum</strong></a>,<a href=#> <strong>Cameron Diaz</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Benji Madden</strong></a> also made the guest list.</p><p class=p1>After Sofia and the music executive’s romantic ceremony, the blushing bride <a href=#>traded her long gown for a minidress</a> that was inspired by one of her childhood role models.</p><p class=p1>“This, to me, is like my little girl dream,” the social media personality told&nbsp;<i>Vogue.&nbsp;</i>“And the fact that it is inspired [by] <a href=#><strong>Claudia Schiffer</strong></a>’s <a href=#>runway dress is iconic and dope</a>. I can dance [and] I can move. I love it! It’s traditional Chanel.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Sofia, who<a href=#> previously dated <strong>Justin Bieber</strong> and <strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>, <a href=#>started dating Grainge in early 2021</a>.
