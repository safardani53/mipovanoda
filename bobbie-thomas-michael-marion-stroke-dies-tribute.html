I&nbsp;lost my husband, Michael Marion, last December&nbsp;at the age of 42, and I've been quietly smelling his old T-shirts since then. The idea that one day, possibly even soon, his smell will fade from the fabric absolutely terrifies me. But I know I'm not alone with this grief or this fear, however odd it may sound...</p><p>...One thing I've noticed about grief, pain and loss is that everyone instinctively wants to make it go away. No one wants to see someone they love suffer. But over the past six months, I've realized that I'm not interested in getting rid of this pain. It's my connection to Michael. It's awful and uncomfortable and all-consuming, but it's also precious."</p><p>Bobbie continues to explain her grief and explain how people may feel alone, but she hopes her story can help people feel less alone.</p><p>"I'm not an expert at loss, but I'm learning and growing in this new state I'm in, and I'm eager to connect with people again and be of service. I'm just not going to give up smelling the T-shirts just yet."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><h2>Do they have any children?</h2><p>The pair have a five-year-old son, Miles.</p><p>He was conceived via IVF after Bobbie's struggle with infertility.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Bobbie Thomas opens up about husband Michael Marion's stroke one year on</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hpaWeEeX2RaJmompKesm7Ax6ikmqtdoraktMCeo2alkae2sLqMrKurp5uaeqW1xKxkraqZl8K1sY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
