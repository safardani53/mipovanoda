Hannah Stuchfield, 41, from Derbyshire, opened The Sausage Dog Sanctuary, where wiener dogs can be pampered with spa treatments, afternoon tea and countryside walks.
She explained: &#34;I got to the point where I'd had enough of the rat race and I was sick of the nine to five office thing - I wanted to do something a little bit more fun and lighthearted."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"And what's more, people seem to collect them. I have two myself.</p><p>"We offer an alternative to kennels. If someone wants to go on holiday people usually have to take their dog to kennels but we are offering home boarding.</p><p>"When you leave your dog in the home with us, they are allowed on the sofas, they are not locked in a kennel all day. They have human interaction."</p><p>Hannah, who dubs herself the 'crazy Sausage Dog person', can keep up to 15 dogs at a time - with husband Ewan, 38, helping out when things get busy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000498058003.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000498058301.jpg><p>"We really wanted to get away from the kennel thing, aiming instead for a more boutique hotel feel," Hannah continued.</p><p>"The Sanctuary reflects what these dogs mean to their owners. You'll get some of them dropping off their dogs in floods of tears like they're dropping their child for the first day of nursery.</p><p>"But even the most stressed dog will soon settle in and you'll even get a postcard from them. We spend time to make sure dogs we have are integrated well.</p><p>"Everyone who contacts me is fully screened over the phone and when they come to the house, they are able to meet my dogs."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>In other news for dog lovers, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Primark has launched it's first ever pet clothing line</a> so you can dress your dog up like a unicorn.</p><p>While this <a href=#>woman has devoted her life to looking after her 22 rescue dogs</a> who all live in her one-bedroom house.</p><p>And a <a href=#>school hired a 'therapy dog' to help teachers</a> unwind from the stresses of exam season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5hsZ3BtZGV8o7vUraCqrZVitbDAxKVkrJmlqK6osYydpqCrXai9onnTq5yarJ2au7W%2FjKmsqaiRmLWqus6sZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
