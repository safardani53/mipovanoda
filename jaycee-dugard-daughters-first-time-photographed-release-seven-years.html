Jaycee spoke to 20/20 on July 8 and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>discussed how she was able to survive her horrific ordeal</a>. Jaycee was kidnapped in 1991 when she was just 11 years-old, and raped repeatedly for the 18 years she was held prisoner in a delaptitated backyard shack.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>She gave birth to Angel when she was only 14, and Starlit when she was 17 after being raped by Phillip. She didn’t let her daughters grow up knowing that she was being held captive; they thought she was their sister until their rescue. She told host <strong>Diane Sawyer</strong> on 20/20 that she was horrified by the gross allegations that she had Stockholm Syndrome — that she stayed with Phillip for 18 years because she had fallen in love with him.&nbsp;“It’s disgusting. I adapted to&nbsp;survive my circumstances. There is just no other way to put it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Jaycee released her memoir, Freedom, at the beginning of July, which devotes a small portion to&nbsp;how her daughters are doing seven years later, and how they got to this point. Both girls are off to college, and are thriving. Jaycee explained that she doesn’t speak more about the girls in the book because “they deserve their own stories.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, we’re so glad that Jaycee’s daughters are doing well.
