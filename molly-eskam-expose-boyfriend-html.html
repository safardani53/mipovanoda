They had similar senses of humor and liked each other.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>They dated for two months. But Eskam and Rug did not see their relationship going anywhere. Rug also admitted that they didn't want to lose their friendship.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>So they decided to break up, and that was it for their relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWfobm6ecSsopqlXZrFsbvSnmSbp6mbv6qxzZ1loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
