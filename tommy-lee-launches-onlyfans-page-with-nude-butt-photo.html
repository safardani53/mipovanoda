"Well, I already won. I showed you my s---. They took it down off the internet. No more d---s, no more titties. Is that it?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lee laughed and continued, "Well, what I've done is I've now gone over to a place where you can be free as f---, and you can show anybody whatever the f--- you want, and they don't f---ing take it down. So, f---ing suck it. Boom!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The "Dr. Feelgood" performer then unzipped his pants, turned around and bared his buttocks â€” featuring the words "ONLY FANS" written across each cheek â€” to the crowd, receiving laughter and applause from the audience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the show, Lee took to his social media pages and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>shared a similar NSFW photo of his behind</a>, this time featuring a flame emoji to hide some of his butt crack. "You heard it here tonight," he captioned the post, linking to his OnlyFans page. "cum join me over there for fun that Instagram won't let us have here! ðŸ¤­"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Sunday, the MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e musician shared a video to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Twitter</a> introducing fans to his latest media platform once again. "Yo, I'm Tommy Lee. Join me over at OnlyFans because I went the f--- over there," he said in the clip. "I'm tired of Instagram policing our bodies, so head on over to the wild side â€” OnlyFans. Let's f---ing go."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lee's OnlyFans announcement isn't the only time fans have encountered his genitals as of late. On Aug. 11, he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>posted a full-frontal nude selfie</a> taken in a hot tub to Instagram and Facebook â€” where it's since been deleted â€” as well as Twitter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A couple of weeks ago, we had like a two-week break off the tour, and I went on a motherf---ing bender, bro," Lee told the audience at a MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e concert in San Antonio, Texas, later that month, according to a video of the moment shared to social media. "I got f---ing sideways as f--- and got naked and posted pictures of my d---."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, "And usually, I mean I'm a titty man, so I like to see titties, but tonight is equal-opportunity night. Tonight I wanna see everyone's d---. C'mon boys, pull your s--- out. Pull your f---ing junk out. Let's go."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Tommy Lee.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Tommy Lee/Twitter</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lee then pointed to a man in a pink shirt and said, "He's ready to pull his d--- out. Show the whole world that motherf---ing hot dog."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Visibly shocked at the callout, the audience member pointed to the woman next to him and shook his head. "The wife says no? Divorce!" exclaimed the rockstar to applause and laughter from the crowd.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The crowd request was apparently made by Lee for multiple nights on the band's recently wrapped stadium tour with Def Leppard, Poison and Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. After asking fans at the Sept. 7 concert in San Francisco to expose their genitals to one another, concertgoer Juan Alvarez told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ABC 7</a> he was shocked and displeasured that he and minor attendees had to see genitals on the Jumbotron.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Minors and everyone was forced to see people nude on the big screen and everyone was doing it around us too. It was like Sodom and Gomorrah, it was crazy. Even the usher had to pull a guy down from the brick wall because he had his private parts out, screaming. It was pretty crazy," Alvarez told the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lee then shared a clip from the news broadcast to his social media pages and said in a voice-over, "The world is too soft! Been doing this s--- for years Karen..I mean Juan! <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@motleycrue</a> concerts aren't PG and never have been!!!! Grow the f--- up!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a follow-up <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>tweet</a>, Lee continued, "Complaining about seeing tits at a MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e concert is like complaining about seeing cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52qwKqvjq2mpqWpYrmmsYylmK6mk52ytHnOp6OynpGjwG68wKCcZq%2BZqbVuutSdnGaapanBbrzHqKuoZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
