The 10-episode series depicts basketball star Johnson in his twenties.</p><h2>Quincy Isaiah’s first acting role</h2><p>Quincy Isaiah, who made his film debut in Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty, rose to prominence as Magic Johnson. Isaiah did not begin his career as an actor.&nbsp;While playing football at Kalamazoo College, he majored in business, but acting has always been a passion of his. So, during his junior year, he decided to change his degree to theater, and two months after graduating in 2017, he relocated to Los Angeles to pursue his dream.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Quincy-Isaiah-2.jpg alt="Quincy Isaiah" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It has not been an easy road for him. The actor struggled to get employment at first until landing the part of Johnson in 2019. His athletic background helped him earn the job, albeit he had to endure some hard training sessions with coach Rick Fox, who was formerly a member of the Lakers.&nbsp;Fox put Isaiah through a few tests, but the newcomer amazed the basketball coach with his endurance, allowing him to pass the exam.</p><h2>What is the plot of the new Quincy Isaiah series?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Quincy-Isaiah-3.jpg alt="Quincy Isaiah" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The HBO documentary Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty, directed by Jeff Pearlman, examines the Lakers’ metamorphosis into a powerful organization that won five NBA championships between 1980 and 1988, allowing them to become a brand. In the series, Quincy Isaiah portrays ‘Magic’ Johnson. Johnson was the on-court guru who established himself as one of the finest basketball players of all time. Isaiah portrayed a young Johnson before all of his honors and stardom when he was an enthusiastic rookie full of confidence. Winning Time debuted on the HBO Max streaming platform on March 6, 2022. The remaining episodes will be shown on Sundays.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Quincy Isaiah</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiorqGemMZutdKaoJqgXZ7AbsDHnmSbqpWWuLDB02aqrZmiYrynedaipaehnpx6tbXMnmStoJViv6q%2FxGamn2WknbJuuMCknKurXZnGr63SrbBmq5ikxHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
