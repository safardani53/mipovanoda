But Badgley could’ve played a massive role against the 49ers but wasn’t trusted by his coach, <a href=# rel=noopener>Dan Campbell</a>.</p><p>The kicker was one of the team’s practice squad for the majority of the year until Riley Patterson parted ways in Week 14. Campbell twice put the ball in Jared Goff’s hands on fourth down rather than attempting a moderately long field goal with Badgley.&nbsp;</p><h2>Michael Badgley Wife: Is Lions Placekicker Married Or Dating Girlfriend?</h2><p>The Lions placekicker Michael Badgley has no wife and isn’t married. The 28-year-old native of Summit, New Jersey, Michael, has never revealed too many details about his personal life.&nbsp;</p><p>The NFL player began his career at Summit High School, where he was a multi-sport athlete. He played hockey, lacrosse, and football and won one state championship in every sport. He was ranked the No.1 kicker in the 247Sports Composite Ranking and later attended the FUMA post-graduate program.</p><p>Badgley enrolled at Miami in 2014 and set a school record with 25 made field goals in his sophomore year. Later that season, he earned ACSMA All-ACC Honorable Mention recognition.&nbsp;</p><p>During his senior year, Badgley became Miami’s all-time field goal leader and was named Lou Groza Award semifinalist. Depiste, his collegiate success, Badgley remained undrafted and was later picked by the Colts.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/michael-badgley-wife.jpg><p>The Colts let him go before the start of the 2018 season, and he signed with the Chargers. He remained with the Chargers until the 2020 season. Since then, Badgley has signed for several NFL teams, including the Bears and the Titans.&nbsp;</p><p>On his Instagram handle, Michael hasn’t shared a single post about his family life. He has only shared photos with his teammates and has tried to share less of his life off the field.&nbsp;</p><p>The placekicker has also not been tagged by anyone special on Instagram. Most of his tagged pictures are of him with his closest friends and them hanging attending events and going on vacation. The footballer is seen all by himself enjoying his friends’ company in these pictures.&nbsp;</p><h2>Michael Badgley Family</h2><p>The football player is the Badgley family’s middle child. The 5’10 kicker is one of two sons of Chris and Leanne Badgley. Michael also has a younger sister named Jamie and an older brother named Pete.</p><p>Michael’s father, Chris Badgley, is a Hobart and Williams Smith Colleges graduate. He was previously a production artist at American Express and later worked for RCI Group in the late 90s and early 2000s.</p><p>Since 2004, Chris has been the Vice President of Sales at Command Financial. Leanne and Chris are available on Facebook and have shared several family photos.&nbsp;</p><p>Michael’s older brother, Pete Badgley, graduated from Providence College and is the Founder and COO of Upside. He established the company in 2019 in Miami and previously worked at Jones Lang LaSalle as a Capital Markets Analyst.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/michael-badgley-family.jpg><p>Pete tied the knot with his longtime partner, Erica, in 2021 and is available on Instagram. Pete might not be an athlete like his brother, but shares the same love for fitness.&nbsp;</p><p>In November, he shared a photo of himself with Erica, showing his medal after he ran through all five NYC boroughs in a marathon.</p><p>Michael’s youngest sibling, Jamie, is an LSU graduate and was part of the Zeta Tau Alpha fraternity.
