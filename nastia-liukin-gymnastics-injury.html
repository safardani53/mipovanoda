With women attempting twists and flips on four apparatuses —balance beam, floor, uneven bars, and vault — gymnastics can definitely <a href=#>take a toll on the body</a>.</p><p>For the Day 3 challenge on Special Forces, the competitors are asked to hold their breath for 20 seconds while inside a car that has been submerged underwater. Nastia is hesitant to participate in the challenge, noting that she has a hard time holding her breath due to a previous gymnastics injury.</p><p>"I understand, this isn't a fear," she tells the Directing Staff. "I hit my face on the [uneven] bar, and I can't breathe like I can't hold my breath more than 10 seconds."</p><p>However, with a bit of coaching and encouragement from the Staff, Nastia gets into the vehicle — alongside former Navy SEAL Remi Adeleke — and completes the challenge.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Nastia Liukin retire from gymnastics?</h2><p>In 2008, the world watched as Nastia was crowned the Olympic All-Around champion at 19 years old.

"I was the reigning Olympic All-Around champion and on my very best event, the uneven bars, I fell flat on my face."</p><p>"I got back up, knowing that my career was over," she continued. "I'm kind of looking forward to figuring out what my limits are and knowing I'm more than, you know, a girl in a pink leotard."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Though Nastia retired from the sport, she didn't walk away from gymnastics completely. The gold medalist currently works as a correspondent in the sport, as well as launched her own line of leotards, hosts her own gymnastics competition (titled the Nastia Liukin Cup), and works as a social media influencer.</p><p>Overall, the elite athlete has proven that she is more than just a girl in a pink leotard.</p><p>Watch new episodes of Special Forces: World's Toughest Test on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST on Fox.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo660wMiaZKWhpaC2r3nGsqSnmaOptqS%2FjKKlo62irg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
