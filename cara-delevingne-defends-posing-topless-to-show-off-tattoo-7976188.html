The model and actress, 31, posed topless in a carousel of photos shared by tattoo artist Matteo Nangeroni to show off her newest ink — the definition of the Italian word, “dormiveglia.” The tattoo defines the word as a noun that means “the place that stretches between sleeping and walking,” per Nangeroni’s post.  Between Delevingne’s topless pose and what many people assume is a spelling error in the definition, the internet came close to losing its mind over the ink — to the point that she had to weigh in herself."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I chose to take my bra off, the picture didn’t look good with my bra on,” Delevingne commented on the post, clarifying the pose. She didn’t address speculation about there being a spelling error in the tattoo, despite many comments that the definition should say “waking” instead of “walking.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Only Murders in the Building</a> actress’ comment continued, “I am a perfectionist especially when it comes to photography and I was trying to help make something beautiful. Everyone calm down please. Thank you x.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the comments of the tattoo artist’s post, several people questioned the model’s decision to pose without a shirt on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Why is she topless if it’s an arm tattoo 🤦🏻‍♀️,” one user commented, while another wrote, “It’s a cool tattoo but I don’t think she has to be shirtless 😂.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You really needed to put here [sic] naked for an arm tattoo? That's why most female clients will not go to a male tattoo artist,” someone else commented.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the artist himself, he was chuffed to have worked on the famous model. “It was an honour and a pleasure to meet you🖤,” Nangeroni wrote in the caption of the post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He tagged the location of the photos as the White Whale Tattoo Society, which, per its Instagram page, is located in Padua, Italy.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Cara Delevingne defends her choice to pose topless as she shows off new tattoo on Instagram.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Cara Delevingne/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ink is nothing new for Delevingne, who has dozens of tattoos scattered all over her body. She’s even made somewhat of a habit of getting tattoos that match those of the important people in her life.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On her birthday in 2020, fellow model <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kaia Gerber</a> revealed on Instagram that she and Delevingne have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>matching tattoos on their feet</a> that say “solemate.” Their coordinated ink lies along the arch of both model’s feet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Happy birthday to my solemate,” Gerber, 22, wrote in the birthday post. She also referred to Delevingne as “the only person who wears my face on a sweatshirt," "the best protest buddy" and, atop a video of them dancing, she called her the "coolest guys at the function."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A year later, Delevingne did the same thing but this time with a new partner. She and her longtime friend and OMITB costar, Selena Gomez, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>got matching tattoos</a> of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>dripping rose</a> under a set of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>roman numerals</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They both got the ink at the same tattoo shop, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Bang Bang Tattoo</a> in New York City. The shop posted a photo of each of the stars and their matching watercolor tattoos, breaking the news.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Cara Delevingne and Selena Gomez.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rachel Murray/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The artist, Keith Scott “Bang Band” McCurdy, wrote in the caption that he had “so much making” the tattoos, revealing, “I didn't tell them til the end that these were my first watercolor tattoos ever.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added, ​​"Thanks for always trusting me Cara🖤.” He also praised Gomez, 31, for “always being wonderful.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That same year, Delevingne got <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>yet another tattoo to match a friend</a> as she and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Paris Jackson</a> debuted identical red ink rose tattoos on Instagram following the Oscars.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The rose seemed to be located on the model’s upper right arm, while Jackson’s is tattooed on her left forearm in between a sunflower and a design that honors her late father, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Michael Jackson</a>.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5OWv6J5w56jnq6Zo7SvsYydnJ%2BdnpnAbrzOrKCnn12pvLG4xKyqZqyfYsCpu9Zmpp%2BeXamutcDOqGRwcWdrfnmE</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
