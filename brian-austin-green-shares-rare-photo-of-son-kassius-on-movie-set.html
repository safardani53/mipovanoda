Brian Austin Green shared a rare photo of his eldest son, Kassius Marcil-Green, from the set of their new film project.
“Another one of Kass and I from the set of Rufus,” the Beverly Hills, 90210 alum, 49, wrote via Instagram on Thursday, October 13, alongside a snapshot of him and the 20-year-old dressed in period clothes while filming in the outdoors.
Green’s girlfriend, Sharna Burgess — who welcomed son Zane with the actor in June — gushed that the pair’s professional collaboration was “so freaking cool,” in the comments on his post."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There shouldn’t be a ‘more important parent’ kids love both parents equally no matter what either parent’s struggles may be. Kass has been truly heartbroken since being cut out of his other families lives with NO explanation. Let’s do better for our kids. Let’s share our stories. #Buddhakids.” A rep for Green did not return Us Weekly‘s request for comment at the time.</p><p>One year later, however, it seemed that Kassius and the Anger Management actor had mended their relationship when <a href=#>he visited him on the set of 90210 in Vancouver</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[Kass] loves him unconditionally and I am very proud of that fact,” Marcil revealed in a September 2020 social media post. “I celebrate Kass’ love for his father and remain extremely grateful that My son was finally invited back into his dad’s life and was able to finally <a href=#>meet his youngest brother and finally see his other two siblings again</a>. My son is also an incredible big brother.”</p><p>Green, for his part, hinted that he and Marcil had finally buried the hatchet in March 2021, when <a href=#>he included her in a roundup of important women in his life</a> on International Women’s day. In addition to the soap star, the Masked Singer alum included photos of his mother, Fox, Burgess, ex <a href=#><strong>Tiffani Theissen</strong></a>, whom he dated from 1992 to 1995. “Happy International Woman’s Day!!” he captioned the posts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabqpmWu26t1KyroqZdnL%2Bmsc1mqqGZoprAbr7Aq5xmqJikwbB5zp9krKeeYriiv9KirKxln6N6rrvVopxmq5WpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
