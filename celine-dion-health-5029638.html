After postponing her tour several times post-pandemic, in December 2022, Celine made the announcement that she was suffering for a very rare <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>health condition</a>, on that may keep her from the stage for a very long time. After canceling her tour in May 2023, Celine promised that she wouldn’t “give up” and said she hoped to get on the road when her strength is back. Here’s everything to know about her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>health scare</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;how she’s doing today, and more.</p><h2>Celine Dion Diagnosed With Stiff Person Syndrome</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Celine shocked the world with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>somber news</a> in 2022 when she revealed her Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) diagnosis with an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>emotional video</a> across social media, including <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. The rare condition, which often affects around “about one or two in a million people,” is known to cause a series of neurological health issues, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>John Hopkins Medicine</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to reach out to you,” Celine said in an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> video at the time. “I miss you all so much and I can’t wait to be <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on stage</a> talking to you in person. As you know, I’ve always been an open book and I wasn’t ready to say anything before. But I’m ready now. I’ve been dealing with problems with my health for a long time and it’s been really difficult for me to face these challenges and to talk about everything that I’ve been going through. Recently, I’ve been diagnosed with a very rare neurological disorder called stiff person syndrome, which affects something like one in a million people.”</p><h2>What Is Stiff Person Syndrome?</h2><p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri=archive.cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_C782181F-134C-405B-8C5E-F3860EE7F908@published data-editable=text data-component-name=paragraph data-analytics-observe=off>Stiff person syndrome can cause muscle rigidity and spasms, heightened sensitivity to sound stimuli and lights, as well as emotional distress that can cause muscle spasms, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. It is so rare, it can take years to diagnose and at present, there is no cure.</p><p class="paragraph inline-placeholder" data-uri=archive.cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph_A1A6D3CA-14C4-59A7-F7EE-F3860EE9DF38@published data-editable=text data-component-name=paragraph data-analytics-observe=off>“It frequently is associated with muscle spasms, which could be quite severe. These can cause falls, severe pain and significant disability,” said Dr. Emile Sami Moukheiber of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Stiff Person Syndrome Center</a> at Johns Hopkins Medicine, to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNN</a>. “Falls from severe spasms are very common.

I am doing a little bit better…but I’m still experiencing some spasms,” she revealed <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>via Instagram</a> on April 29, 2022. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mom-of-three</a> not only had to postpone the tour in April 2022, but she also was forced to do the same in Dec. of that year as her condition had not improved enough to return to the stage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>In April, Celine said she was “doing a bit better”, however, the recovery was “going very slow.” And eight months later, sadly, Celine was not recovering at the speed she had hoped. The condition affects her ability to walk, use her vocal chords at “100%” capacity, and more. “I have a great team of doctors working alongside me to help me get better, and my precious children, who are supporting me and giving me hope,” Celine assured her supporters in Dec. “I’m working hard with my sports medicine therapist every day to build back my strength and ability to perform again.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/celine-dion-health-ev-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>The talented artist also came forward about the health condition in Jan. 2022, however, she had not revealed the official diagnosis yet. Celine released <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a statement</a> via Instagram and shared with her 5.5 million followers that “severe and persistent muscle spasms” are “preventing her from performing.”</p><h2>How Is Celine Dion Doing Today?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Celine appeared to be on the road to recovery, as she created new music for the 2023 film, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Love Again</a>, starring&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Priyanka Chopra</strong></a>. The Canada native will appear in the film alongside Priyanka and Outlander‘s&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sam Heughan</strong></a>. Celine took to Instagram in Nov. 2022, just weeks ahead of her diagnosis clip, to announce her appearance the rom-com. “See you at the movies! Celine is starring alongside @priyankachopra and @samheughan and releasing new music for the romantic comedy LOVE AGAIN (new title!) coming to movie theaters MAY 12 (new date!),” her team captioned <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the post</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Her sister Claudette reportedly spoke to a local news outlet in Canada about her sister’s health, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Marca, </a>in January of 2023. “I am confident that life will give her back what she gave because she is an extremely intelligent woman, very generous and talented and in love with life as well,” Claudette said at the time. “Rather than crying over her fate, I try to send her positive vibes in the hope that one day she will go back on stage. I truly believe in the power of love. I wish her the best of luck, that’s for sure. She is surrounded by specialists as she works to recover.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Celine has continued working to improve her condition. With the announcement that she was canceling her Courage world tour, she shared that she still couldn’t hit the road. “I’m so sorry to disappoint all of you once again. I’m working really hard to build back my strength, but touring can be very difficult even when you’re 100%,” she said on May 26, 2023. “I want you all to know, I’m not giving up… and I can’t wait to see you again!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Months after Claudette’s last update on her sister, she reportedly spoke to Le Journal de Montreal (via&nbsp;<a class=class href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>SheMazing</a>) in August 2023 to deliver somber news about Celine. “We can’t find any medicine that works, but having hope is important,” Claudette reportedly told the outlet. The concerned siblings noted that she thinks Celine needs adequate rest. “I honestly think that she mostly needs to rest. She always goes above and beyond, she always tries to be the best and top of her game,” she added. “At one point, your heart and your body are trying to tell you something. It’s important to listen to it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>In addition, Claudette revealed that her sister,&nbsp;<strong>Linda Dion,</strong>&nbsp;has moved in with Celine is reportedly her live-in caretaker in Las Vegas. “When I call [Celine] and she’s busy, I speak to my sister Linda who lives with her and tells me that she’s working hard,” she told the outlet. “She’s listening to the top researchers in the field of this rare disease as much as possible.” Despite the ongoing health struggles for their siblings, the family reportedly “trusts” that things will improve.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>In November 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Closer</a> reported that Celine “feels stronger now” despite having “gone through hell” over the past year. “She doesn’t want to hide out at home any longer,” an insider told the outlet. “She has good days — even weeks — and she’s committed to sharing those times with her children.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>A month later, Claudette opened up again about Celine with another update. “She’s working hard, but she doesn’t have control over her muscles,” Claudette told 7 Jours (via the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>) for a December 2023 interview. “What breaks my heart is that she’s always been disciplined. She’s always worked hard. Our mother always told her, ‘You’re going to do it well, you’re going to do it properly.'”</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Still, the family hasn’t given up hope for Celine returning to the stage. Claudette explained, “It’s true that in both our dreams and hers, the goal is to return to the stage. In what capacity? I don’t know.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>A report followed days later, claiming Celine is working on regaining muscle control with physicians. “Celine is a fighter,” a source close to the singer told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly </a>for a December 22, 2023 report. “She doesn’t have as much control over her muscles as she did before, but she’s working with doctors and physical therapists to get better. ” The insider added, “Celine has been taking time to focus on her health but plans to take the stage again once she is given the go-ahead by her medical team.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Keo6KmlWKxqrvNZp%2BemZyptW6Bj2twb2toZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
