On the track "Would've, Could've, Should've," she sings about a past relationship from when she was 19 (Swift and Mayer were first linked when she was 19 and he was 32).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Mayer also seemingly referenced their past during an April 2023 concert.

"It's almost like <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Taylor Swift</a> is a character in a movie about a small-town girl who has her dreams come true and [does] what any small-town girl would do when her dreams come true, which is to freak out.

The singer spoke effusively of the country-turned-pop star.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You could put her in a time machine in any era and she would have a hit record," he said before presenting Swift with the ​​Hal David Starlight Award.

The song is widely believed to be about her breakup with Mayer, partly based on the title — although a "Dear John" letter is a common idiom referring to a woman ending a relationship with her partner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The lyrics seem to reference the couple's fallout, according to fans, who point to the line, "Don't you think nineteen is too young/ To be played by your dark twisted games / When I loved you so?" as evidence that the song is about Mayer.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-october-2010-taylor-swift-opens-up-about-the-inspiration-for-dear-john></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>October 2010: Taylor Swift opens up about the inspiration for "Dear John"</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking to PEOPLE about the inspiration for the song, Swift declined to share who it was about.

The song includes lyrics like "22" (the name of Swift's hit single, released the previous October), a mention of a red scarf (referenced in Swift's "All Too Well") as well as "Someone's gonna paint you another sky" — which is seen as a direct response to a line from Swift's breakup anthem ("You paint me a blue sky and go back and turn it to rain").</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-september-30-2012-taylor-swift-says-john-mayer-is-presumptuous-for-assuming-dear-john-is-about-him></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-101 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>September 30, 2012: Taylor Swift says John Mayer is "presumptuous" for assuming "Dear John" is about him</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Glamour</a>'s November 2012 cover story, Swift made a rare public comment about Mayer.
