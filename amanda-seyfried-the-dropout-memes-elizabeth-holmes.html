Sometimes, I feel really old because I’m seeing all of these young actors on all of these incredible shows that I’m just obsessed with and I’m like, ‘God, I’ve reached a new age!’ And it’s great because I get opportunities that are good and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>are actually way better,</a> more interesting for me as a parent and all that, but sometimes I’m like, I feel so f**cking old!” Amanda laughed. “Then, I see memes and I’m like, ‘I think I really like this!’ This is good for me to be folded into the younger social media generation!”</p><a title=@justbri_always href=# rel=nofollow>@justbri_always</a><p id=content-paragraph-4><a title=fyp href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#fyp</a> <a title=seriesbybri href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#seriesbybri</a> <a title=thedropout href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#thedropout</a> <a title=huluoriginal href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#huluoriginal</a> <a title=tvtiktok href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#tvtiktok</a> <a title=tvtok href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#tvtok</a> <a title=viral href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#viral</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a title="♬ Zou Bisou Bisou - Gillian Hills" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ Zou Bisou Bisou – Gillian Hills</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The actress, who was honored by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety </a>for her work with INARA (International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance), spoke openly about why she believes there is a thirst for stories about these egomaniac con-artists,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> like Elizabeth Holmes</a>. “I think because they’re being caught. It’s important to show that they’re not getting away with it,” Amanda told HL. “There are a lot of people who were getting away with it, but a lot of people are held responsible and so, don’t even f**king try it. That’s one of my perspectives.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>She continued, “I think also people just really love a fall from grace. They love a downfall. They love an uprising, for sure, but we love a downfall more because they get in trouble, they’re held responsible and I think that we love that as a society.
