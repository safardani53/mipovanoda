“We’ve been staying in an amazing villa with a pool and jacuzzi,” the Dancing With the Stars pro, 29, exclusively tells Us Weekly. “We’ve loved swinging on the bed swing at the beach and swimming in the ocean, then coming back to the room to lay out by our private pool."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Pregnant <a href=#><strong>Witney Carson</strong></a> and husband <a href=#><strong>Carson McAllister</strong> </a>enjoyed a babymoon in St. Lucia before she gives birth to <a href=#>their second child</a>.</p><p>“We’ve been staying in an amazing villa with a pool and jacuzzi,” the <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> pro, 29, exclusively tells Us Weekly. “We’ve loved swinging on the bed swing at the beach and swimming in the ocean, then coming back to the room to lay out by our private pool.”</p><p>The couple just finished a relaxing trip to<a href=#> Sandals Grande St. Lucian Resort</a>, and they stayed in the luxurious Rondoval Butler Suite.</p><p>The DWTS season 19 champ and the mechanical engineer, also 29, share 2-year-old <a href=#>son Kevin Leo</a>. Since becoming parents, they’ve tried to prioritize getting some adults-only alone time.</p><p>“It’s always important to us to make a trip [for] just Carson and I once a year,” the Utah native explains to Us. “For the past two years, we’ve loved our experience at Sandals! We both think it’s crucial to make time for each other, especially when life gets crazy.”</p><p>The So You Think You Can Dance alum and her husband were high school sweethearts. They tied the knot in January 2016 and welcomed their son five years later. She announced during a November 2022 episode of Dancing With the Stars that <a href=#>baby No. 2 was on the way</a> and revealed in January that she <a href=#>is expecting a little boy</a>.</p><p>“We wanted this time to reconnect before entering this new chapter in our lives with two kids!” Carson gushed to Us of her babymoon at Sandals. “We are so excited to welcome this new baby boy!”</p><p>Previously, the two have enjoyed having active vacations at the Grande St. Lucian. “We love to take advantage of the all-inclusive scuba diving,” the choreographer reveals. “We got certified last year and it’s been one of our favorite things to do as a couple. We love the excursions and lounging by the gorgeous beach or pool!”</p><p>It’s been a more laid-back trip this time amid Carson’s pregnancy. “Last year we did lots of excursions and more activities, and this time around we relaxed by the beach and pool! Both trips were so amazing in different ways,” she tells Us.</p><p>The lovebirds enjoyed some golf at the <a href=#>Cap Estate Golf and Country Club</a> and soaked up the sun by the water during their babymoon.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Our ultimate favorite thing to do while at Sandals is order the pizza to the beach, listen to music and relax! We love Sandals because there’s really everything for everyone,” Carson says.</p><p>Scroll down for exclusive photos of Carson and McAllister’s babymoon:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktq%2B%2FyJ2cZq%2BZqbumxYycmKurn6N6orrDZpqaqqOku265wpqjpaGjqbKzv4ybmJuxnaS8r3nPoaatp6Nk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
