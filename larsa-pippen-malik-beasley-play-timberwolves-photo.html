Continue to speak on my name and my relationship and we’re going to have issues. Receipts don’t lie. Let’s not go there. I think you’ve embarrassed yourself enough already,” she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Larsa-Pippen-Lounges-Watching-Malik-MEGA-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The former&nbsp;Real Housewives of Miami&nbsp;star was first papped holding hands with Malik at a mall in November. Shortly after the very public outing, Montana hinted on social media that this was the first she knew of her husband’s apparent new relationship. “This is wild y’all,” she wrote, cryptically, on Instagram. “I’m seeing it for the first time like y’all.” She then <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed for divorce</a> on Dec. 8, and called the NBA player out for never issuing her a private or public apology. “Things have been pretty rough, I’m not going to lie,” she wrote in her post. Just weeks later, Malik and Larsa make their relationship Instagram official by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posing in front</a> of a Christmas tree on Dec. 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye49xZqWZoqiubrzIqaeepl2irq21ymaZnpmjobK6ec%2BlmLJlpJ66o7HRsKalrpWoerG0zq2maA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
