especially as they cost a of fraction of the Brazilian brand's.</p><p>Unless you have been avoiding social media all year, you'll probably be familiar with Sol De Janeiro which went viral thanks to it's iconic Bum Bum Cream.</p><p>Though it has ingredients like caffeine, which will help tighten skin, a stunning tropical scent and a super hydrating formula - the viral cream also costs nearly £30 for a single 150ml pot.</p><p>Unfortunately for any would be beauty gurus, the rest of Sol De Janeiro's range is similarly pricy with their tropical scent retailing for £22 or more online.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more from Hair & Beauty">Read more from Hair & Beauty</h2><p>However, you can start saving for that trip to South America - simply by swapping to Primark's incredible <a aria-label="dupes (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dupes</a>.</p><p>For instance, the high street giant has a sensational fragrance balm, Coconut, which reportedly smells identical to Sol De Janeiro's Coco Cabana.</p><p>Rather than paying over £20, you can pretend you are topping up your sun tan with this perfume stick as it is only £2.50.</p><p>If you are still looking to turn up the heat with your beauty buys, there is another Sol De Janeiro dupe that you need to pick up in store.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Also recommended by <a href=#>Tiktok</a> page <a href=# aria-label="@dontmesswiththedupes (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">@dontmesswiththedupes</a>, Primark's second summery scent will also <span id=bb68bb2c-d6c4-42bd-a761-018ba1aa93b8 class=suggested-link>transport</span> to a tropical paradise.</p><p>Cleverly named Tropical, the scent stick is said to be a copy of Sol De Janeiro's Rio Radiance perfume - which is currently selling for £35 online.</p><p>With the same notes of coco and warm sand, it's easy to see why beauty gurus have been stocking up on Primark fragrance balm - especially as it costs a fraction of the retail price.</p><p>In fact, you can get the Tropical fragrance balm for only £2.50 alongside many other thrifty finds in the <span id=d9cba865-27f8-49e2-9fda-73bc068eda58 class=suggested-link>Boxing</span> Day sales.</p><p>For those still trying to recreate a <a href=#>luxury</a> holiday at home, the Tiktok channel has also suggested you pick up Primark's Pre Tan Body Priming Spray whilst you still can.</p><p>This had 100ml bottle will help you get the classic <a href=# aria-label="holiday tan (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">holiday tan</a> without damaging your skin, as it is the perfect base for fake tan.</p><p>Even better, this low cost product is said to be a dupe of Isle of Paradise's Prep It spray and gives a similar streak free finish.</p><p>Whilst the high end brand will cost over £14 per bottle, Primark sells their version for just £3.50 meaning you can have glowing skin even during the grey <a href=#>weather</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>One comment even revealed that you don't need to use a lot of the product, warning others: "A little goes a long way with the <span id=c4ae151f-d052-4f5d-a98e-47d45c2d67b9 class=suggested-link>tanning</span> drops.. trust me."</p><p>Though you'll be booking that much needed holiday soon, these items are a great alternative -
