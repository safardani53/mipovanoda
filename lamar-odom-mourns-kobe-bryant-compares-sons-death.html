(Bryant’s 13-year-old daughter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gianna</a>, nicknamed “GiGi,” was also killed in the crash, along with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>seven other people</a>.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“These picture are just the tip of the iceberg of our relationship,” Odom began the lengthy caption. “He taught me so many things in life that were necessary on and off the court. On the court he taught me how to carve out defenses and how to take my time. How to make winning my ultimate goal.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Off the court he taught me to sign my own checks lol. Of course anyone who knows my story knows I’ve suffered a lot of loss but the only loss I can compare this to is when I lost my son,” added Odom, whose 6-month-old son <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jayden</a> died from sudden infant death syndrome in 2006.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Even though our relationship wasn’t father/son, it was more like him being a teacher and me being his brother,” he continued. “I’m glad I got to be the ying to your yang as far as the locker room was concerned. It was my pleasure. I couldn’t even catch my breath today when I heard this news. I just knew if he was in a helicopter crash he would have been the one to survive. Somehow he would have jumped out and landed on his feet.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added: “I’m sitting here thinking about when we would be in practice scrimmaging and you would start the jump ball off with elbowing Sasha in the chest. Like dude it’s 10:30 in the morning lol. You think watching him play was crazy, you gotta think in practice if you scored like 8-9 buckets throughout the practice you had a great practice. I’ve seen him knock off 13-14 in a row in practice!!!! I’m still waiting for the media to come out and say wrong report. No way God took my brother this early. I know I been through my own stuff in life with using drugs and not being good to myself.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Odom also referenced his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>2015 hospitalization and coma following a drug overdose</a>, writing, “When I went through that Coma situation if God would have came to me and said we would take me and spare Kobe I would have rather that happened.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“In honor of my brother I’m up at 4am tomorrow to get to the gym!” he said. “Gigi gone give you buckets!!!! I love you brother ???? @kobebryant.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kobe and Lamar.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Noah Graham/NBAE via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Odom formed a close bond with Bryant during their seven seasons on the Los Angeles Lakers together from 2004-2011, which included several championship victories. In his 2019 memoir <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Darkness to Light</a> — which recalls Odom’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>struggles with drugs</a> and marriage to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Khloé Kardashian</a> — he praised Bryant for his leadership and friendship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Kobe Bryant played a crucial role in my life,” he said, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vibe</a>. “I have recently started to reflect back about my relationships and I’m so grateful for the people God gave me. His love and care was so deep I should have given you my 6th man award just because I feel you deserved it…I hope you know that I’m extremely blessed to have you in my life not only as a friend, Laker fam, but also as a father figure that I never had.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2016, Odom <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>attended Bryant’s final NBA game</a> before retirement alongside his son Lamar Jr. and daughter Destiny. Ahead of the game, Odom shared a special video message for his friend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Bean, what’s up. It’s your little brother LO. I just want to tell you I love you.
