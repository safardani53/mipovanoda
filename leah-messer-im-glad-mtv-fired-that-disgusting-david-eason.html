If you watch Teen Mom 2 online, you’re going to see David Eason abruptly vanish from your screens."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Oh I forgot that’s supposed to be normal."</p><p>That is, of course, a horrifying thing to tweet for anyone. Not only does it imply that LGBT&nbsp;parents are somehow unfit parents, but that they and their families are abnormal.</p><p>And then he doubled down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Someone else tweeted, asking if David Eason planned to teach his children to hate gay and transgender people.</p><p>"No I’m going to teach them not to associate with them or be that way … If you lay down with dogs you get up with fleas."</p><p>One, teaching your children to not associate with LGBT people is teaching them bigotry.</p><p>Two, you absolutely cannot "teach" someone to not be who they are, only to deny and hide it, leading to a miserable existence.</p><p>Three, that analogy with the dogs and fleas isn’t true for any responsible pet owners. Yes, that’s beside the point, but it’s worth noting.</p><p>And finally, four: His inaccurate analogy also implies that LGBT folks are somehow filthy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Obviously, <a href=#>David Eason was slammed for his homophobic rant</a>, because there is still good in the world and even on Twitter.</p><p>Jenelle Evans also caught some well-deserved flack. People asked if she wants her children raised to be angry bigots.</p><p>MTV’s response had real consequences — they severed their relationship with David Eason immediately.</p><p>With weeks of production left, he won’t receive any further money.</p><p>One can be cynical and say that MTV is worried about sponsors pulling out (which, to be clear, they definitely were), but perhaps producers and execs also have certain lines that they won’t allow stars to cross.</p><p>Teen Mom 2 is down one villain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In a statement to Us Weekly, even the normally non-confrontational <a href=#>Leah Messer supports David Eason’s firing</a>.</p><p>"I am disgusted by the recent statements made by David Eason and support MTV’s decision to fire him 100 percent."</p><p>She’s really not mincing words. She was nicer than this when <a href=#>Jenelle Evans called her a cheating drug addict</a>.</p><p>"This ignorance cannot be tolerated and I refuse to be associated with hatred of any kind."</p><p>Good for Leah Messer for taking this strong moral stance.</p><p>"I stand in solidarity with my friends and family in the LGBTQ community and applaud MTV for their quick and decisive action."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Of course, even if David Eason’s no longer on the payroll, he’s still married to Jenelle and she’s still a Teen Mom 2 star.</p><p>With all of the fame and all of that sweet, sweet Teen Mom money that comes with it.</p><p>Is it only a matter of time before the Teen Mom 2 archvillain is held accountable? Not just for the things that she says, but for the frightening way that she raises her children?</p><p>Or is that more of a job for social services and the courts and not really MTV’s job?</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>David Eason Goes on Insane Homophobic Rant; Jenelle Evans’ Husband Fired By MTV …</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2V%2FcLjEmp9mpZWowKa%2BjKKkZp%2BclrFuudOvZJ%2BhopqxbsDHmqtmnJmotLa%2F06KloGWUlsOqsIyemKynnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
