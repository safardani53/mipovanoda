In the snap, André smiled for the camera while laying sprawled out on a couch with a heart emoji covering his lower region. The model, for her part, could be seen taking the snapshot in the mirror behind him.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The Eric André Show star told Rolling Stone that while there “wasn’t much thought” behind posting the stripped-down photo, the pair both “<a href=#>agreed this was a beautiful image</a> that we had to share with the world.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">André added that he loved the “spontaneity” of the moment, labeling the situation a “happy accident.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“It was one of those things,” he explained. “I think that’s what art is about. Art is not intellectual; it’s primal. It has to speak to your hormones as much as it speaks to your mind.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The My Body author and the<i class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</i>Bad Trip&nbsp;actor <a href=#>first sparked romance speculation in January</a> when they were spotted out on the town in New York City. The two were photographed getting cozy and putting their arms around each other as they made their way through midtown Manhattan. Later that month, they were seen packing on the PDA in a more tropical climate while enjoying a getaway to the Cayman Islands.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">In February, the duo used their saucy Instagram post to seemingly confirm their romance. “💘&nbsp;💘💘💘💘Happy Valentine’s Day&nbsp;💘💘💘💘💘,” André captioned the image.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Just days after their NSFW reveal, however, Ratajkowski fueled rumors that the twosome called it quits when she posted a TikTok video about a “situationship” ending.&nbsp;The clip featured the England native laying on the bed with overlayed text that read: “What should you do when a situationship ends? Start another one.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Prior to her fling with André, the Gone Girl star dated <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a> for two months before Us Weekly <a href=#>confirmed their split</a> in December 2022. The romance came after Ratajkowski’s divorce from <a href=#><strong>Sebastian Bear-McClard</strong></a>, with whom she shares 2-year-old son Sylvester.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Ratajkowski and Bear-McClard, 42,<a href=#> tied the knot in February 2018 but split in July 2022</a> after four years of marriage. At the time, the&nbsp;We Are Your Friends&nbsp;star filed for divorce amid rumors of infidelity on the producer’s part. Their divorce was finalized in September 2022. (Bear-McClard has not publicly commented on the cheating allegations.)</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The&nbsp;Lying and Stealing&nbsp;star opened up about her decision to end things with her ex-husband while appearing on the “<a href=#>Going Mental With Eileen Kelly</a>” podcast earlier this month.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“I didn’t have the courage to leave for a long time. I was really, really unhappy,” she said of her relationship. “I was, like, 100 pounds and I had just had a baby. I got really skinny ’cause I was not OK.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Before the exes ultimately called it quits, Ratajkowski revealed she “tried everything else” to fix her mental health.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“I tried to take antidepressants. <a href=#>I was sure that something was wrong with me</a>,” she recalled. “I think so much of what I learned coming out of that relationship is to trust your instincts. Gaslighting is a real thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaeqpmYeqK6w6ucZp2opbmitc2sZKetlJp6prnIpbBmqpGprqu3zrCqpKFdq66tsc2toKedo2K9qbvTqGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
