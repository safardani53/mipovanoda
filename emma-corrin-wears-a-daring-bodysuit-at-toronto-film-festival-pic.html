The actor delivered drama at the Toronto International Film Festival, stepping out in nothing but a high-cut bodysuit.</p><p>The <a href=#>Crown </a>star, 26, attended the premiere of My Policeman on Sunday, September 11, wearing a leotard that featured whimsical sleeves from Miu Miu. Corrin opted to go pants-less, pairing the look with sheer tights and shiny black pumps. The U.K. native kept the bold theme going with their glam. Corrin took notes from <a href=#>Euphoria</a>, rocking metallic highlighter and heavy black eyeliner. The Pennyworth actor had their hair styled in a gelled pixie cut.</p><p>Corrin stars in My Policeman alongside <a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a> and <strong>David Dawson</strong>. The film, which is based on the book by <strong>Bethan Roberts</strong>, tells a story of forbidden love. The movie will officially hit theaters on October 21.</p><p>Sunday’s screening wouldn’t be the first time Corrin has tapped Miu Miu for a red carpet appearance. At the 2021 Emmys, the actor made a statement in a custom yellow strapless dress from the French label. The look featured fingerless gloves, which exposed Corrin’s dramatic black claw nails. The ensemble was finalized with a coordinating cap. (That year Corrin was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama series for her portrayal of Princess Diana in The Crown.)</p><p>It’s been a big year for the Golden Globe winner. Their dazzling style moment in Canada comes after they <a href=#>graced the cover of Vogue‘s August issue</a>. Corrin appeared on the front of the magazine, flaunting armpit hair in a tweed top and a baseball cap. “My grin really says it all! A huge honor to be your August cover,” they said via Instagram at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Emma-Corrin-Wows-in-High-Cut-Leotard-Fishnets-and-a-Cape-at-Toronto-Film-Festival.jpg><p>In the <a href=#>interview</a>, published on July 6, Corrin spoke about gender fluidity, sharing, “In my mind, gender just isn’t something that feels fixed, and I don’t know if it ever will be. There might always be some fluidity there for me.”</p><p>Corrin <a href=#>came out to fans in April 2021</a> when they shared images via Instagram from their Pop Magazine spread. “Ur fave queer bride,” Corrin captioned the social media post, which showed them in a wedding dress. At the time, the actor also changed their pronouns in their Instagram bio.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since the reveal, Corrin expressed to Vogue that they feel “more seen.”</p><p>“I feel much more seen when I’m referred to as ‘they,’ but my closest friends, they will call me ‘she,’ and I don’t mind, because I know they know me,” the actor expressed. They revealed that their family has also been supportive. “I started dating a girl and told my mum, and then my little brother DM’d me saying, ‘Hey, I wanted to say welcome, because I’ve been bi for ages.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5q6rq2MnKarqpmjerixwKuqZpldma6ztc2gZJunlK7AtrXTZpitZaSkv7C606hkn6GconqnsdKtoK%2BZnGK9qq%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
