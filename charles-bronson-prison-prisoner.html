People don't believe it.</p><p>"They think I'm a serial killer."</p><p>His solicitor Dean Kingham wrote a letter to Justice Secretary <a href=#>Dominic Raab</a> to grant Bronson a free pardon.</p><p>The letter said: "You have the power under the Prerogative of Mercy to grant Mr Salvador's release without requiring him to go in front of the Parole board... he has not been violent for a significant number of years and his risk is primarily towards prison governors.</p><p>"The evidence in excess of the last five years is clear that his risk of violence has significantly reduced.</p><p>"The argument is that if he's been able to demonstrate that he's not violent in very high-risk situations in custody towards staff, governors, etc. then the risk falls away if he's released into the public because historically, while there was a risk to the public, it's never been as severe as that toward prison staff and governors.</p><p>"There is very good psychological research evidence that as someone ages the risk of violence decreases.</p><p>"When someone approaches 70 the research shows that the risk drops off to zero.</p><p>"Now, he's at that age bracket."</p><p>While admitting that he understood the Parole's concern about Bronson being a threat to public safety, Kingham added: "The Parole Board regularly releases people that have been convicted of murder.</p><p>"The whole process is based on reduction of risk."</p><h2>What crimes has Charlies Bronson committed?</h2><p>Bronson has been found guilty of a range of crimes which have attributed to almost 50 years behind bars.</p><p>He has 17 convictions and has taken 11 hostages during his time inside.</p><p>He was jailed for the first time in 1974, receiving a seven year sentence for armed robbery.</p><p>However, due to repeated attacks on prison guards, he wasn't released until 1987.</p><p>In 1994 Bronson held a prison librarian hostage, demanding an inflatable doll, a helicopter and a cup of tea as ransom.</p><p>In 1999, he held prison art teacher <a href=#>Phil Danielson</a> at knifepoint for 43 hours at <a href=#>HMP Hull</a>.</p><p>As a result of this incident, in 2000 he was sentenced to life in prison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4V2hJhscGibmJa%2FrbHSZpmrp56ovK95z6ugrKeeYr2ztdKopZ6qXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
