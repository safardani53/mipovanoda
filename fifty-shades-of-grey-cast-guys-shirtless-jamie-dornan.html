Jamie Dornan As Christian Grey We’ve been obsessed with Jamie ever since he played Sheriff Graham/The Huntsman on the first season of Once Upon A Time. We didn’t even care that his character was hooking up with the wickedest witch in town — because at least it meant we got to see him in bed!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Read on for the scoop on each of your options:</p><h3>Jamie Dornan As Christian Grey</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>We’ve been obsessed with Jamie ever since he played Sheriff Graham/The Huntsman on the first season of&nbsp;Once Upon A Time. We didn’t even care that his character was hooking up with the wickedest witch in town — because at least it meant we got to see him in bed! And do we even need to explain why we love his latest Calvin Klein underwear campaign? This man is&nbsp;flawless. The only downside to casting Jamie as Christian Grey is that we won’t get to enjoy his dreamy Irish accent.</p><h3>Luke Grimes As Elliot Grey</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Luke is another guy we’ve loved ever since seeing him on an ABC drama. He played the (apparently) ruthless Ryan Lafferty on&nbsp;Brothers & Sisters, and while we didn’t like seeing him try to take down the Walker family, at least he looked damn good while doing it! We were also thrilled to see him join&nbsp;True Blood&nbsp;in its sixth season — especially because most of his scenes were clothing-optional. We’re&nbsp;still&nbsp;recovering his character’s sex scene with Jessica. Talk about H-O-T!</p><h3>Victor Rasuk As Jose Rodriguez</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Victor may be the least known of the three&nbsp;Fifty Shades&nbsp;guys, but he’s hardly new to Hollywood. Besides appearing in movies like <i>Jobs&nbsp;</i>(2013) and&nbsp;Lord of Dogtown (2005), he also starred on NBC’s&nbsp;ER&nbsp;and HBO’s&nbsp;How To Make It In America. Given his hot new role, we’re thinking it won’t be long before Victor is a household name — and heartthrob!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, which&nbsp;Fifty Shades&nbsp;guy is YOUR favorite?
