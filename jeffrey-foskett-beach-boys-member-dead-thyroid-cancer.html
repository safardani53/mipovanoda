Love and Mercy to Jeff's family and friends, we will remember him forever."</p><p>Full House actor John Stamos, who has long been friends with the <a href=#>California</a>-founded band, shared a series of pictures of him with Foskett in a touching tribute on <a href=#>social media</a>.</p><p>"Today, I lost more than a friend; I lost a part of my soul, my history - Jeffrey Foskett, my dearest friend, brother, and brightest light in my life, has left this world," Stamos grieved.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>"This morning, when I got the news, uncontrollable tears streamed down my face, a physical manifestation of the heartache within.</p><p>"My son Billy heard my cries, joined my wife in holding me up, and then ran off, only to return with a small tender offering - a drawing.</p><p>"His innocent hands sketched a picture of Jeff with hearts ascending to heaven, with me, waving goodbye.</p><p>"A stairway of hearts, and next to the top heart, he wrote God.

I realized that this pain is the price we pay for the privilege of knowing and loving someone like him.</p><p>"Yes, the pain is excruciating and cuts deep into our souls, but it is a testament to the depth of our connection."</p><p>Stamos ended his tribute by sharing that the two had been friends for more than 40 years and thanked him for "every moment and piece of wisdom" that Foskett shared.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>THE BEACH BOYS</h2><p>Raised in San Jose, California, Foskett became a Beach Boys fan after hearing their single I Get Around.</p><p>In 1976, on the day of his 20th birthday, he courageously knocked on Wilson's door in Los Angeles and was welcomed with open arms.</p><p>"Brian opened the door and said, 'Hey, come on in' - like he'd been expecting us," Foskett told the <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles Times</a> in 2012.</p><p>"I said, 'Great!' We hung around and went to the music room... He said, 'Stay in touch.' And I did - and I'm glad that I did."</p><p>Years later, Beach Boys singer Mike Love visited a Santa Barbara restaurant where Foskett played and invited him to join his Endless Summer Beach band for the recording of his album.</p><p>Around the same time, Wilson's brother, Carl, stepped away from the band to focus on his solo career, and Love offered Foskett to fill the void of the Beach Boys.</p><p>After touring with the band for nearly a decade, Foskett left in 1990 to focus on his solo career.</p><p>Between 1998 and 2013, he toured alongside Wilson before eventually rejoining the Beach Boys under Love's leadership in 2014.</p><p>In 2018, Foskett was diagnosed with terminal cancer.</p><p>He disappeared from the public eye and updated his fans on his status on March 4, sharing a video of himself ringing a bell at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston after spending four years in treatment.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"These people have given me what no one else on earth could have...
