Hardiman-McCartney, clinical adviser to the College of Optometrists shares what you should be using instead.</p><p><strong>Stop cleaning them with washing up liquid</strong></p><p>Washing up liquid and warm water is the most commonly used mixtures for cleaning glasses, but, unfortunately, it’s also one of the most destructive.</p><p>Using the grease-busting chemicals or surfactants in washing up liquid, will ruin the fragile lens coating on your glasses.</p><p>It may even cause them to craze, which is when a web of tiny cracks appears on the lenses of eyeglasses coated with an anti-reflective coating.</p><p>Daniel says: "Eventually people will be able to spot that crazing damage on the surface of your lenses, but from afar it’ll just look like your glasses are dirty."</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>FABULOUS BINGO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET A £5 FREE BONUS WITH NO DEPOSIT REQUIRED</a></strong></p><p><strong>Stop cleaning them with the corner of your clothes</strong></p><p>It is far too easy to simply wipe your glasses with the end of your t shirt or skirt.</p><p>However, it is pretty terrible for your glasses.</p><p>Daniel reminds us that: "You could be rubbing dirt – which may not always be visible to the naked eye – into your glasses.</p><p>The tiny bits of dirt will not only fail to clean your glasses but could also cause lots of tiny scratches on your lenses too.</p><p>Some clothing materials such as wool, are far too abrasive for cleaning your glasses.</p><p>No matter how clean and dirt-free your clothes are, they can still scratch the lenses.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p><strong>Stop cleaning them with hand sanitizer</strong></p><p>Hand sanitiser, which we see everywhere now, during a pandemic, is too strong for your glasses too.</p><p>Alcohol is a strong and aggressive chemical which will eventually erode the lens coatings and the frames of your glasses, really taking no prisoners this stuff.</p><p>Since bottles of hand sanitiser with an alcohol content of 60% or higher are recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), it rules out using most hand sanitisers on your glasses.</p><p><strong>Stop cleaning them with household glass cleaner</strong></p><p>It may seem logical that using household glass cleaner would also work on your glasses, right?</p><p>Well, the ingredients in household cleaners aren’t meant to be used on reading glasses as they are actually damaging and ineffective at cleaning them well.</p><p>"Household glass cleaners tend to smear when used to clean spectacles, and some of the chemical ingredients will also wear away the varnish on your frames, so they’re not recommended," Daniel explained.</p><p>Remember to take your glasses off before using a spray of any kind.</p><p>There are even hidden dangers in using the harsh chemicals near your eyes, as Daniel admitted: "I’ve seen plenty of people who’ve hurt themselves because they forgot to take their glasses off before spraying them."</p><p><strong>Stop putting your spit on your glasses</strong></p><p>It may be an abundant resource that is always readily available but that does not mean your glasses will appreciate a quick spruce up from your mouth fountain.</p><p>Daniel shared that he has seen people put their contact lenses in their mouth to clean them before putting them back into their eyes, which is totally gross.</p><p>The reason you should keep saliva away from your eyes is that it puts you at an increased risk of corneal (front part of your eye) infections, sounds nasty.</p><p>Steer on the safe side, avoid the risk and don’t use saliva to clean your specs.</p><p><strong>Stop using soap on your specs</strong></p><p>Gentle soap can be used to clean dirt or oil stuck on the frames of your glasses, but keep it away from the lenses.</p><p>Shop-bought soaps have surfactants just like the ones in washing up liquid so it is best to avoid them completely.</p><p>If you are desperate to clean your frames with ol' reliable soap, lather it in your hands and apply to the frames.</p><p>Gently rinse the suds off off with a slow stream of lukewarm water and always dry them carefully after.</p><p><strong>Stop rinsing your glasses with hot water</strong></p><p>Rinsing your glasses is a gentle way to clean off dirt and grit that could scratch your lenses, but scorching hot water will damage them as it could remove the protective coating.</p><p>Lukewarm water is kinder to your glasses than hot water, as it is less aggravating.</p><p>"They’re delicate and aren’t designed to cope with high temperatures. Boiling water will be especially damaging." Daniel explained.</p><p><strong>Stop using UV light cleaners</strong></p><p>Daniel admitted that since the beginning of the pandemic he has often been asked if UVC lights are good for cleaning glasses and he's even seen them advertised on social media.</p><p>"While there are some studies that say UVC light can be effective at viral cleaning, the College of Optometrists and the Scottish Government conducted an evidence review on this topic and weren’t convinced."</p><p>Even if UVC light can sanitise your glasses, it won’t remove any grease or dirt from them, so they’re still limited and not the best choice.</p><p>UVC light is also dangerous as exposure can damage your eyes and skin.</p><p><strong>Stop using tissue on your glasses</strong></p><p>Lint fibres are the tiniest little magnets for dust, so if you use lint-based tissues to wipe your glasses you will probably scratch them and still leave damaging dust bits on them.</p><p>Most kitchen rolls should be fine to use as they are generally lint-free.</p><p>Baby wipes should be fine too as they are mostly alcohol-free to avoid irritation.</p><p>Check the packaging as it doesn’t always make it obvious what is lint-free.</p><p><strong>What are the best options for cleaning your glasses then?</strong></p><p>An alcohol-free liquid lens cleaner with a gentle microfibre cloth is the best option according to Daniel.</p><p>Most optometrists will give you a bottle of lens cleaner and a microfibre cloth when you first buy your pair of glasses, so make the most of these.</p><p>Compostable soft microfibre lens wipes are also ideal for getting your spectacles sparkling.</p><p>Daniel does warn however, that: "They’re also quite expensive as there’s an ongoing cost for them."</p><p>The wipes are handy for travelling, as they are disposable, so are worth investing in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000703505997.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000702728405.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000703506309.jpg><p>For more cleaning tips, check out <a href=#>why you’re cleaning your black jeans all wrong</a> – the right way helps maintain their color longer</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Plus, <a href=#>how to clean your radiators and make your house smell amazing</a> – you’ll be amazed at how filthy they get</p><p>Find out why&nbsp;<a href=#>you’ve been using your washing up liquid wrong – how to banish the bubbles</a>&nbsp;in seconds</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>How to get your silver jewelry looking brand new with two simple household items</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BwaWtxY2qEcMXOrq2eZZKasq95wqWcmqaZo7Ruxc6uqWafnJbAtLHSZpilpF2sv7C6xmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
