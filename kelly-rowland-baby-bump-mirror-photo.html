Her curly brown locks were swept back into a high ponytail as she adorably brushed her teeth in the mirror. It comes just days after Kelly revealed her pregnancy when she appeared as the cover girl&nbsp;for the latest issue of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Women’s Health</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“We had been talking about it loosely, and then COVID happened, and we were just like….let’s see what happens,” Kelly told the outlet. Luckily, it didn’t take long, as Kelly got pregnant “right away.” The former&nbsp;<strong>Destiny’s Child&nbsp;</strong>hitmaker is expecting her second bub with her husband, <strong>Tim Weatherspoon</strong>. The couple are <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>already parents to a son</a>&nbsp;named&nbsp;<strong>Titan</strong>, who celebrates his sixth birthday in November.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kelly-rowland-baby-bump-ap-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kelly also admitted she was “nervous” about sharing her baby news, amid the craziness of 2020, but decided she wanted to “remind people that life is important.” She also added, “I’m knocking at 40’s door in February. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taking care of myself</a> means a lot to me.” Prior to this pregnancy, Kelly said she was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in the “best shape</a> of [her] life”, which fans saw a lot of on social media, as she regularly posted stunning <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bikini photos</a>.
