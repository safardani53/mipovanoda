The right toothbrush head is the one that is perfectly sized to reach all your teeth and gums. If you are not sure what size of replacement head you should buy for your toothbrush, then consider purchasing one that measures one inch in height and half-inch in width since this size fits almost all adults. However, you can also find larger toothbrush heads but keep in mind that these require more effort to maneuver, hence it can be difficult to reach the molars.</span></p><h4><span>Bristle variety</span></h4><p><span>For choosing the right replacement toothbrush head for yourself, you should consider the type of bristles that the head features. Toothbrush heads usually feature soft, medium, or hard bristles. Soft bristles are the most common and safest choice for both kids and adults since these work great for sensitive teeth and are comfortable to use. On the other hand, medium bristles are a decent option for people who have issues with plaque and other oral health problems. Lastly, hard bristles are not recommended for everyday use since these can be harsh on the hums, causing them to bleed. These are suitable for occasional use to remove stains.</span></p><h4><span>Cost</span></h4><p><span>The cost of the replacement toothbrush is another essential thing to consider since toothbrush replacement heads can be expensive. At times, a single replacement head for a toothbrush head can cost more than the toothbrush itself, hence it is wise to look for the unit that offers maximum effectiveness while being low on the price. Luckily, there are many units that are cost-effective, therefore it should not be difficult to find one for yourself.</span></p><h4><span>Dentist’s recommendation</span></h4><p><span>Though not necessary, it is always wise to get your dentist’s recommendation on what type of toothbrush replacement head you should get. Not only will your dentist be able to recommend the brand you should consider, but also what type of bristles would suit your teeth and gums the most. Other than that, you can also ask which design would be the most suitable for cleaning your teeth thoroughly.</span></p><h4><span>Easy to clean</span></h4><p><span>Look for a toothbrush head that is easy to clean. Your toothbrush can accumulate a lot of bacteria from your mouth if you don’t wash it after use. If you plan to clean your toothbrush with a sanitizer, then look for a toothbrush head accordingly since a lot of toothbrush head sanitizers are made for full-size toothbrushes for which you can’t replace the heads.</span></p><h4><span>Effectivity</span></h4><p><span>Since the main purpose of replacing the toothbrush head is to improve the performance of the toothbrush, the effectiveness of the replacement head is something that should not be ignored. It is essential to look for a unit that effectively cleans your teeth, ensuring that there is no plaque or buildup left behind after use. To ensure that a replacement head is effective, you can read online reviews of the product. Moreover, since your oral health is important for your well-being, you should always try to buy from a brand that is well known for manufacturing high-quality products.</span></p><h3><span>How Frequently Should You Replace Your Toothbrush Head?</span></h3><p><span>It is recommended by dentists that you should replace your toothbrush every 3 months. However, you might need to replace the head of the toothbrush even sooner than that if it loses its effectiveness due to bristles getting frayed. Toothbrushes that are ineffective not only fail to clean your teeth, but also cause several other oral health issues due to bacterial buildup. Some of the most important reasons to replace your toothbrush head include:</span></p><h4><span>Germs</span></h4><p><span>Toothbrush heads can accumulate a lot of germs and bacteria over time. Hence, not replacing your toothbrush head can cause mouth infections and bad breath.</span></p><h4><span>Gum damage</span></h4><p><span>Worn-out bristles tend to be disastrous for your gums. Not only do these cause your gums to bleed, but can also lead to long-lasting gum diseases such as </span><span>periodontal gum disease, gingivitis, and more. Since these issues only tend to increase over a period of time, you must replace your toothbrush head in a timely manner.</span></p><h4><span>Reinfections</span></h4><p><span>If you use your toothbrush while being sick, then there is a big chance that you might end up reinfecting yourself by using it again when you are well. This is because the bacteria can live on the bristles of the toothbrush and even multiply over time. Hence, it is crucial that you change your toothbrush head once you are feeling well.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwvMSrqqimkaF6pK3RnmarnaChrqSxzJ6lrWWkpLy1tMGrrKygXZ2yorCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
