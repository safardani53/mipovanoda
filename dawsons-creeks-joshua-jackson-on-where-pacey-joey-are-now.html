The couple welcomed their first child, a daughter, in April 2020.</p><p>“A whole new world of things has just opened up to me in <a href=#>experiencing fatherhood and this magical, joyful, chaotic</a>, stressful anxiety-inducing love that you did not know you had the capacity for,” the proud father told Us Weekly exclusively on July 8 while promoting the Peacock series. “It just expands every single day.”</p><p>He added that despite the very heavy and dark material, he felt lucky to come home to a “beautiful wife [and] beautiful baby” each night, adding, “My life is very warm and supportive.”</p><p>Jackson starred as Pacey Witter on <a href=#>The WB’s teen soap</a> from 1998 to 2003. The series finale, which jumped five years ahead in time, ended with Pacey and Joey Potter (Holmes) living together in New York City.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Joshua-Jackson-Says-Joey-Pacey-Would-Have-Run-Away-Paris-After-Dawson-Creeks-End-002.jpg><p>While the When They See Us alum still has a happy ending in mind for the pair, the show’s creator doesn’t necessarily agree — at least he didn’t in <a href=#>2018 when the cast reunited</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think Pacey and Joey got married. I think they had a family, I think there were troubles.<a href=#> I think they got a divorce</a>,” <strong>Kevin Williamson</strong> told Entertainment Weekly at the time of where they’d be if the show came back. “I think that when we meet them they’re in a very dark place. But there’s still something between them that forces them to come together and raise their children.”</p><p>The Folllowing creator added, “As they seek out happiness with others, they just keep coming back to each other. And they just can’t stop <a href=#>that magical thing that exists</a> between them and that bond they have. I think we would sort of have to watch them fall in love all over again as middle-aged adults.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuar6Oku7R5wqucnqOjYrewv8eumGaikZi4tLvNZqanZaedsrOxjKmYnJ2pYrewsdhmmKudXaO8uHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
