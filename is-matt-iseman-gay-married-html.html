The tweet in question features Iseman carrying the Queer Eye&nbsp;star in his arm, who, in return, seems pretty excited by the act.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Almost as if pouring hot gasoline to the already fired-up rumor mill, the snap was accompanied by a caption that read, "@mattiseman and I leave on a gay cruise in the am! #congratulations."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Matters got even more suspicious when Iseman <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appeared</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;RuPaul's Celebrity Drag Race&nbsp;and participated in one of the fantastic lip sync battles.

There are records of past tweets where the&nbsp;American Ninja Warrior&nbsp;host acknowledged having a girlfriend. Sadly, the tweets have since been deleted.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>His Views on Getting Married and Wife</h2><p>In 2013, the Emmy Award-winning show host <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a>, in a now-deleted tweet, that he was going home to celebrate his parents' 50th wedding anniversary. He further added that he'd better start taking vitamins and get <a href=# rel=follow>married</a> if he wanted a shot at the same milestone. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>But even&nbsp;nearly 8 years since that tweet, there&nbsp;is&nbsp;no news about his marriage yet.</p><p>In another instance, in yet another deleted tweet from 2014, Iseman shared his thoughts&nbsp;on divorces in Hollywood.&nbsp;He claimed that he was doing his part in keeping Hollywood divorces at a low by not getting married in the first place.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>All in all, it can be stated that Iseman is interested in the ladies.
