After the dramatic conclusion premiered on Netflix in July 2022, the official Twitter account for the writers room offered a glimpse atthe scenes that almost never made it to the screen.
“‘I love you, man’ was improvised by Joe,” the account tweeted alongside a photo of Joseph Quinn and Gaten Matarazzo filming a conversation between their respective characters Eddie and Dustin."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Viewers were in for a wild ride when <a href=#>Stranger Things</a> season 4 <a href=#>ended with more questions than answers.</a></p><p>After the dramatic conclusion premiered on Netflix in July 2022, the official Twitter account for the writers room offered a glimpse at<a href=#> the scenes that almost never made it to the screen.</a></p><p>“‘I love you, man’ was improvised by Joe,” the account <a href=#>tweeted</a> alongside a photo of <a href=#><strong>Joseph Quinn</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Gaten Matarazzo</strong> </a>filming <a href=#>a conversation between their respective characters Eddie and Dustin.</a></p><p>During the second installment of season 4, Eddie and Dustin worked together to distract the bats in the Upside Down <a href=#>while their friends faced off against Vecna</a> (<a href=#><strong>Jamie Campbell Bower</strong></a>). Following an epic guitar solo, Eddie decided to stay behind to buy the group more time and <a href=#>was fatally attacked by the monsters.</a></p><p>For Quinn, getting to portray <a href=#>Eddie and Dustin’s friendship was a major highlight ahead of his character’s demise</a>. “As men, it’s not always easy to show the complexities of different kinds of love, especially in your adolescence,” he told Esquire in July 2022. “There were always guys that were a bit older than me that I really kind of was enamored by. And I also felt that with guys who are a bit younger than me, there’s this kind of patronage there. And we just wanted to kind of make it as visceral as possible.”</p><p>The U.K. native also <a href=#>praised the development Eddie went through</a> before his death. “I had a feeling that we would finish his arc this season. I couldn’t have imagined the manner in which he would leave, but yeah, I think it’s a weird thing. It’s kind of bittersweet,” Quinn admitted. “I would love to go back to that set and to see those people again. But sometimes there’s a beautiful arc that they’ve written and he’s such an empathetically written role and they’re very rare, these kind of roles. It feels a little bit like a lottery ticket and I feel incredibly grateful, but it’s a shame not to be able to come back. Onwards.”</p><p>At the time, the actor also opened up about <a href=#>how “daunting” it was to film scenes involving Eddie, Dustin and Steve</a> (<a href=#><strong>Joe Keery</strong></a>).</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“People love that dynamic, and it’s so brilliant the way [Gaten and Joe] bounce off each other. And being his sort of ‘side Joe,’ as it were, I didn’t know how people were going to respond to that because it felt like a pretty closed gang,” he told TV Line that same month. “But they were so brilliant and welcoming, and they wound up being one of the things I enjoyed most.”</p><p>Scroll down for all of the scenes that were altered by the actors while filming:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BowbOtzaCcq2Wknbavs9Jmqp6Zo6S7boCMpaCnnaNiwamt02aunqqVYrauvNGoraKrlZl6o8WMrZ%2BeZZGYwbC%2B0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
