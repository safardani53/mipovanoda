As for his girlfriend, Kelsey Kreppel, she is also a YouTuber, albeit not as successful as her beau.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But that hasn't stopped her from flaunting their&nbsp;picture-perfect relationship on her socials.&nbsp;Here are four&nbsp;times Kreppel showcased their adorable relationship on Instagram.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Happy Birthday Ko!</h2><p>There are few gestures of saying "I love my boyfriend," which can top a slideshow of snaps that begins with you licking his hair in public. And that is exactly what&nbsp;Kreppel did!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On November 23, 2020, Kreppel took to her Instagram to celebrate Ko's birthday with a series of adorable candid snaps. The slideshow&nbsp;saw everything from the couple sharing a drink&nbsp;to feeding kangaroos and ended with Ko doing what appears to be a Jim Carrey impression with their pet dog.&nbsp;</p><h2>Modeling for Her Beau</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Like many other successful YouTubers, Ko lets his fans show their support by purchasing his merch. And being the loving girlfriend that she is, Kreppel had to help.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On March 6, 2021, the up-and-coming YouTuber shared another carousel of snaps on her Instagram, where she donned her beau's merch. The first still in the series showed Kreppel twerking for the camera as Ko pointed at her.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The second snap saw her hugging her boyfriend as the camera captured what can only be described as a meme-worthy face, while&nbsp;the next two snaps were&nbsp;zoomed-in renders of the same picture.&nbsp;</p><p>The confident girlfriend then announced in the caption that she killed the photoshoot! <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Jump the Beat</h2><p>You know what they say, "A couple that twerks together, stays together." While that might be the exact saying,&nbsp;Kreppel and Ko exemplify this truth. A&nbsp;video Kreppel uploaded on January 13, 2019, proves this hypothesis.</p><p>The video captured the adorable couple doing more of their shenanigans, i.e., flaunting their hilariously ridiculous dance moves for their fans to enjoy as Teesingle's 'Butterfly Doors' played in the background.</p><p>That wasn't the only time that they flaunted their dance moves. A few months prior, on June 19, 2019, the doting girlfriend&nbsp;uploaded a similar video of the couple jiving to <a href=# rel=follow>Blueface</a> and Rich The Kid's 'Daddy.'&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>To be fair, it was mostly Kreppel doing the dancing while her boyfriend stared awkwardly into the camera. Eventually, he warmed up to the beat and attempted a few dance moves.</p><p>In his defense, she confessed that he was forced into making the video. The beautiful couple will be celebrating their fourth anniversary this September.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJufmcZut85mnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnWWhrJ2h</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
