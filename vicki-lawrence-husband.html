Vicki and Bobby wed in 1972 and soon developed a creative partnership. During the first year of their marriage, they collaborated on a song called “The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia,” about a man reportedly being murdered for a crime he didn’t commit.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia” became a chart-topping hit. In 1973, Vicki added the song to her album of the same name. Unfortunately, the pair divorced after Vicki’s album debuted, and she said the marriage lasted “about 10 minutes.”</p><p>After her marriage to Bobby ended, Vicki focused on her work on The Carol Burnett Show. Eventually, her place of employment would be where she met her true love, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Al Schultz</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Al worked as a makeup artist in Hollywood for Marilyn Monroe and Doris Day before landing a job on The Carol Burnett Show. Carol reportedly scooped Al up when she noticed his attractiveness.</p><p>“Carol found my husband for me,” Vicki shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “Al [Schultz] had just gotten into the makeup union, and Carol was sitting in her dressing room, and Al walked by. She told her secretary that he was adorable and wanted him on the show. Carol has been largely responsible for most everything in my adult life.”</p><p>Carol’s decision brought Al and Vicki together, and the couple married on November 16, 1974. They then welcomed two children — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Garrett</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtney</a> — and have been in wedded bliss ever since.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Vicki Lawrence related to Carol Burnett?</h2><p>Vicki has often credited Carol with being one of her biggest supporters. Although <a href=#>they’re not related</a>, the comedians’ big sister/little sister relationship seems quite natural. Carol selected Vicki to play her younger sister after an 18-year-old Vicki wrote her a letter informing her that they looked alike.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After Carol received the letter, she drove to Inglewood, Calif., to see her perform at the Hollywood Race Track’s Fireman’s Ball. Although she was pregnant then, Carol convinced her second husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Hamilton</a>, to take her to the event.</p><p>“She used to tell a funny story about coming down the freeway and her husband saying, ‘What the hell is she, a jockey?’ And Carol said, ‘You know what? I have a hunch. I’m pregnant; just indulge me.’”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Carol rewarded Vicki with a spot on The Carol Burnett Show after the Ball and continued to have her back as they worked together on the show. Vicki said her mentor “saved my job” when CBS almost fired Vicki when she became pregnant with her daughter in 1975. Luckily, Carol stepped in and told the network to “Bring Vicki back” so they could continue their “Mama” sketches.</p><p>Call Me Kat airs new episodes Thursday nights at 9:30 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfq7akt8hmo5qvopq7pLGMoaysmpGjsQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
