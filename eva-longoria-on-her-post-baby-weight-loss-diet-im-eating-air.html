The Desperate Housewives alum talked about her strict diet with Us Weekly exclusively at Eva Longoria’s Global Gift Foundation Women Empowerment Luncheon presented by CÎROC Summer Watermelon in Beverly Hills, CA, on Thursday, May 9. “I’m eating air,” she joked.
And she hasn’t indulged since starting her healthy eating plan and intense fitness regimen six months ago."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Not yet. When I get to Cannes, I’m going to be drinking some wine,” she said, referring to the famous French film festival, which begins on May 14 this year. “But, no, I haven’t drunk wine. I haven’t eaten sugar. I haven’t seen a carb in awhile.”</p><p>“But once I get to Cannes and finish the red carpet,” the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Longoria Foundation</a> founder continued, “then I’ll be indulging a lot.”</p><p>The Sylvie actress, wed to media mogul <strong>José “Pepe” Bastón</strong>, has been sharing her tough workouts with trainer <strong>Grant Roberts</strong> on Instagram. On Tuesday, May 7, Longoria, 44, posted a video of herself doing a stationary squatting row that showed off her toned arms and shoulders. “Getting it in before Cannes!” she captioned the Instagram video. “Thanks to @grantrobertsfit for the past 6 months of torture!”</p><p>Longoria also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Us in December 2018</a> that after giving her body “time to adjust to postpartum and post-pregnancy” following the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">birth of her son</a>, Santiago, in June 2018, she was getting into “very serious weight training.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Eva-Longoria.jpg><p>The star appears to be back to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-baby size</a> and looks more toned than ever. Her secret, she joked at the luncheon, is “just being committed to being hungry.” After laughing, she added, “No, it’s honestly just being committed to a goal. I wanted to get back in shape for my son. It’s hard! It’s a lot of work with children. I’m exhausted. But just to stay in shape and be the healthiest me I can for him.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And though she’s dedicated to exercising, she makes sure gym time never interferes with her favorite moments with her son every day: “I love waking him up. I like to be the first thing he sees in the morning,” she told Us. “And then I love putting him to bed. Those are my two favorite moments.”</p><p>With reporting by Nicole Pajer</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaerpFiubC6xqipopldpLtutMSrZKmno6l6o63BsmSwnZmctbV5y6iqrGWUnrK1ecimZJ6ZpJ67qHnAoqlo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
