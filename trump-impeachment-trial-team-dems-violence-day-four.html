So why are we here?"</p><p>However, following Trump's defense team's presentation, Rep. Joaquin&nbsp;Castro was the first to answer a question.</p><p>"Donald Trump summoned the mob, he assembled the mob and he lit the flame," Castro said, when asked whether the Capitol breach would've happened without Trump.</p><p>The third question, intended for Trump's team, asked: "Exactly when did President Trump learn of the breach at the Capitol? What specific actions did he take to end the rioting, and when did he take them?"</p><p>Van Der Veen appeared to disregard the question and blamed the House managers for doing "zero investigation."</p><p>Prior to the start of the hearing, Trump's defense team said they planned to slam "hypocritical" Democrats for "inciting violence" as Republicans ripped prosecutors for turning the Capitol riot into a "movie."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000635135889.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000635876441.jpg><p>The former president's lawyers began presenting their case at noon on Friday after <a href=#>impeachment managers warned Trump could get elected and “do it all again”</a> if he's not convicted.</p><p>Speaking to Fox News as Dems explained their case, Schoen said his team would give "a much better picture of what's going on here," according to the Associated Press.</p><p>"I think you will at least be moved by what you see and get a much better picture of what exactly is going on here and the hypocrisy and some of the positions taken by the House managers in this case.</p><p>"They built a sort of a false dichotomy here. Either you condemn what he said and find him guilty or there's no middle ground."</p><p>Schoen - who criticized the impeachment hearing as an "offensive entertainment package" - also revealed that Trump's prosecutors will not need to take a "long time" to prove their point.</p><p>"This is what you get when you bring in a movie company and hire a large law firm to make a professional product - that takes things out of context," Schoen argued.</p><p>As Trump's defense team was set to present their case, President Joe Biden revealed: "I'm just anxious to see what my Republican friends do. If they stand up."</p><p>Schoen also said: "This trial never should have happened - given the complete lack of evidence and the harm that this is causing to the American people."</p><p>"Do you think it leads to healing to show and reshow the tragedy that happened here at the Capitol, lives lost that had nothing whatsoever to do with President Trump.
