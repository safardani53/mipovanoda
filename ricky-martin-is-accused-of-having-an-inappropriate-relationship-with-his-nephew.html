This is a new development in the aftermath of domestic abuse allegations that appeared online earlier this month.&nbsp;Marca, a Spanish news site, revealed the fresh complaint, claiming that it came from Martin’s 21-year-old nephew. The musician and his nephew allegedly had a seven-month connection, according to the newspaper. According to the gossip, the claimed romance ended two months ago.&nbsp;If the claims of incest are found to be accurate, Martin could face up to 50 years in jail under Puerto Rican law.</p><h2>What did Ricky Martin’s agent have to say about the allegations?</h2><p>Ricky Martin’s lawyer criticized the individual who accused the artist of such behavior after Marca publicized the accusation. According to his agents, DailyMail.com:</p><p>“Unfortunately, the individual who made this allegation is dealing with serious mental health issues. Ricky Martin, of course, has never been — and would never be — in a sexual or romantic connection with his nephew.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ricky-Martin-2.jpg alt="Ricky Martin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The spokesperson went on to say:</p><p>“The notion is not just false, but also repulsive. We’re all hoping that this individual receives the assistance he really needs.”</p><p>Ricky Martin’s older brother, rock musician Eric Martin, identified the victim as their nephew Dennis Yadiel Sanchez, according to Marca. However, it is unclear why the 61-year-old named Sanchez was the victim of Martin’s alleged assault. As of yet, neither sibling has commented on the current charges between Martin and his nephew. Furthermore, it is uncertain if the words made by the aforementioned representative were directed toward Eric Martin.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ricky Martin addressed the prior charges of domestic abuse against him in early July. The 50-year-old Puerto Rican native posted on Twitter:</p><p>“Because the protection order issued against me is based on wholly false charges, I will react in court with the truth and dignity that define me. I am unable to make comprehensive remarks at this time due to the pending legal proceedings. I am thankful for the many words of support, which I accept with open arms.”</p><h2>Netizens respond to Ricky Martin’s rumored connection with his nephew.</h2><p>Following the charges, a slew of Twitter users went to the site to vent their outrage. Some even made fun of the circumstance by referencing Martin’s 1999 hit song Livin’ la Vida Loca. The jokes were over the song’s English title, which roughly translates to “Livin’ the Crazy Life.” They compared the translation to Martin’s present circumstance, in which he is suspected of engaging in an improper and unlawful connection with his 21-year-old nephew.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Ricky-Martin-3.jpg alt="Ricky Martin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Some tweets went on to make fun of the singer’s rendition of the song and refused to recognize it. Instead, they recognized the song Livin’ La Vida Loca, which was performed by Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas’ characters in Shrek 2 in 2004. A few tweets even sarcastically credited these two celebrities with creating the aforementioned music.&nbsp;As of yet, there is no confirmation of Martin’s claimed connection with his nephew. Neither the Puerto Rican sources nor the nephew, Dennis Yadiel Sanchez, have reacted to the allegations.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Do not look at why Ricky Martin is trending. You’re happier not knowing.</p><p>Now, some of you are thinking, “I can handle it. I’ll look it up, and I’ll be fine.” You won’t be fine. Don’t do it.</p><p>Close Twitter, log off and enjoy life. I’m begging you.</p><p>— Brianna Wu (@BriannaWu) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">July 15, 2022</a></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipopubrnqurdGtoKdlmah6oq%2FCrqqenF2ks260wK%2Bgp59dlrtutc2ap6mqn6W%2Fqq3TnmSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdrLa1tIyhoKxlnpq9qbHWaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
