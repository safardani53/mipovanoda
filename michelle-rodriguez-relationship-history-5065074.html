Then a year later, she landed on the cover of a “lesbian magazine” which many took as her coming out as gay, which she denied at the time, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. “If I wanted people to know what I do with my vagina I would have released a sex video a long time ago,” Michelle quipped on her website at the time, per the outlet, adding, “Yet I haven’t done that.” In 2011, during a red-carpet appearance, she maintained, “I’m not a lesbian….yeah. Michi likes sausage.” Then, five years later, the actress admitted to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET</a>, “I’ve gone both ways. I do as I please.
