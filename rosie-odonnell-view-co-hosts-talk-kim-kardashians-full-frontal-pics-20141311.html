Co-hosts <strong><a href=#>Whoopi Goldberg</a></strong>, <strong>Nicolle Wallace</strong>, <strong>Rosie Perez</strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Rosie O'Donnell</a></strong> addressed them during the Hot Topics segment of their show, and had a lot to say on the topic.&nbsp;</p><p>"Kim Kardashian tried to break the internet with her butt, and now she's showing us the other side. So I guess people are a little freaked out by it, but is the full-frontal thing bothering anybody here?" Goldberg began the discussion.</p><p>"You know, I think that it's an issue of taste and class," Perez replied. "Because a lot of people give women a lot of crap for celebrating their bodies. And just because you're a mother doesn't mean that your sexuality is just erased, or the celebration of your sexuality should be erased."&nbsp;</p><p>Perez went on to single out sexy mom Julianne Moore, who has repeatedly shed her clothes onscreen. "That's high art to me," she said. "This? I don't know. I don't know. It's a beautiful picture from a wonderful photographer. It's a beautiful, beautiful picture. But…"&nbsp;</p><p>O'Donnell interjected then in defense of the reality star. "If I looked like Kim Kardashian, I would be naked in the frozen foods section of the A&P," she quipped. "This might shock you: No one has ever asked me to pose naked."&nbsp;</p><p>Co-host Nicolle Wallace piped in next, pointing out that nudity isn't as big of a deal in many European countries. "It's very prudish that we're all wigged out about the nakedness," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>The ladies also talked about Kardashian on Wednesday, the morning after her butt-baring cover shot was revealed by Paper. O'Donnell was not present for the discussion, but Wallace was more than happy to share her opinion.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"It's a picture of something that I'm not sure exists in nature, but as a mother, I'm thrilled to see a sexy mother on the cover of a magazine," she declared, joking that she's become a student of everything Kardashian.</p><p>"She's worth 45 million dollars. Her husband <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong> is worth 110 million dollars. And these two have a direct line to their fan base," she continued. "It matters not at all what anyone says…This is a fashion shoot. People do fashion shoots all the time, [and] take ridiculous pictures…I sort of admire the businesswoman side of her. I think it's great."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGarp6Oesm67w6ilp52coXq3tcSwZJynXZ28tMDSZquapJtiuKq5jKSYq5yRqLWqrc2sZJ%2BtnKF6p77Op6uapF2ltqS%2FjGtnamxhaH5yew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
