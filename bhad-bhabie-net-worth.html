But since then, she's created a whole new life for herself as the rapper <a href=#>Bhad Bhabie</a>. She's only been releasing music for a few years, but she's already proved that she can make serious hits. Her music and talent have shown people all over that she's more than just a meme — and that has translated into her getting some serious cash.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Of course, she's known for her music, but Danielle is expanding her streams of income. She's auctioning her own collection of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFTs</a> (or Non-Fungible Tokens) to give fans a chance to own unique art and collaborations from the artist herself. And she's made an account on OnlyFans that net her more than $1 million in a single day. With so much success, it's no wonder her net worth is as big as it is.&nbsp;Let's take a look at how she has made her money.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">First of all, what are NFTs?</h2><p>NFTs are digital assets that can bring in tons of money. Bhad Bhabie is making her own one-of-a-kind collection called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ETH me Outside</a>. This set features art, music, and her famous "Cash Me Outside" meme. The set is currently up for auction on Opensea, Rarable, and Zora and will be available until April 1, 2021. The collection is a collaborative work with 15 different artists and consists of 20 NFTs, all of them based around the meme that she's known for.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>“At first the idea was just to make an NFT for the meme and sell it but then we found all these amazing artists that wanted to make pieces for the drop," Bhad Bhabie said in a statement. "So many of them wound up being girls that we did our own female and non binary drop called Crypto Bhabies. A few of these I’m definitely hanging on my wall."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Now, Bhad Bhabie has an OnlyFans account.</h2><p>Bhad Bhabie turned 18 in March 2021 and pretty much immediately decided to add to her net worth with an <a href=#>OnlyFans account</a>. Right now, it's not clear if she's making NSFW content for the platform, but she has said she's made millions. "Not bad for 6 hours," she said in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> showing that she made $1,030,703.43 on the platform over that short amount of time. "We broke the f--k out of that OnlyFans record."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Right now, there's no public content on Danielle's OnlyFans, but for $23.99 a month, users can get access to everything. In captions, she's suggesting that her content may be NSFW with things like, "I be wearing too little sometimes" and she did promote the page while wearing lingerie sets. She also says that she checks her DMs, so fans may have a chance of getting to talk to her via the subscription service.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Bhad Bhabie's net worth?</h2><p>Bhad Bhabie is worth a reported $4 million but this OnlyFans money could obviously make that number skyrocket. A lot of her wealth comes from her music, considering she was pretty much immediately successful in that industry. In fact, at 17 years old, Danielle was the youngest female artist to ever make it on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Since then, her wins haven't stopped. She's done sponsored posts on social media for Fit Tea and Postmates. And since she has such a large following, she's definitely getting tons of money from the NFT thing, too.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Bhad Bhabie also has a million-dollar deal with Pulse Music Group that she signed in July 2019. Since then, her music has only continued to garner tons of attention and praise. She's had her own Snapchat show, Bringing Up Bhabie, and was paid $900k to promote <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CopyCat Beauty</a> back in 2019. The line features makeup, brushes, and face masks, and the rapper also gets a cut of the brand's sales, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to TMZ</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But none of this includes all the stuff that Bhad Bhabie owns. She's not one to be shy about showing off her money on social media. She spent $90k on a Porsche before she could even drive at the age of 14. Plus, she bought her own home in home in California as well.&nbsp;It's safe to say that she's living pretty comfortably these days — and even more so as her NFTs go up for auction and she continues taking over the OnlyFans scene.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7WisIybn5qamZp6r7HTZq6oqqSd</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
