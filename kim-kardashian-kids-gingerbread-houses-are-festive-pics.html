The youngest child of the reality star and ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> picked out a cozy silver cottage with gumdrops and miniature trees covered in snow surrounding the home. To top it off, his name is displayed on the roof while a gingerbread man keeps guard. Kim noted that she would let her son keep his in his bedroom and that they “smell so good.”</p><p>Next, the TV personality showed off <a href=#>Chicago</a>’s creation, which was a “rainbow” house. Attached to the colorful roof were the names of her cousins and friends: <a href=#>Dream, True, Stormi and Dove</a>. All five of them had themselves recreated as gingerbread characters standing in front of the delicious household ready to celebrate the holidays.</p><p><a href=#>Saint</a>, meanwhile, opted for a more creative home: his very own tropical holiday gingerbread creation. His mom described it as a “Tommy Bahama tropical holiday surf house” and noted it was “so cute.” Surrounding the home were tiny palm trees and even a little grill. The ground used brown sugar to mimic sand, and Kim joked that the sweet powder would probably be gone soon. Like his sister Chicago, Saint also had his friends’ names added to the roof and had several gingerbread people to coincide.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The businesswoman’s eldest daughter, <a href=#>North</a>, chose a larger and more traditional gingerbread home. Like her siblings, her name was patched on the roof alongside some of her closest friends — like <a href=#><strong>Jessica Simpson</strong></a>’s daughter Maxwell — and <a href=#>her two dogs Sake and Sushi</a>. Each name on the roof had a corresponding cookie placed out front the residence.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see all of Kim and her kids’ elaborate gingerbread homes:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyxtcKtrKudo2S4qrmMpJirnJGotaqtzWaiopyjYrSqusaeqZuqlZaxbrTOrqqeq12Wv6Z5xZ6qraGmmnqxtcKsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
