She wore a furry white jacket over a red plaid shirt and her hair was styled with pink accessories.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I usually prefer to be the judge & give the final ruling but she got it… (this time 😏),” the doting mom captioned the post.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>It didn’t take long for Gabrielle’s followers to comment on the memorable video and most of them loved it. “The lean back with the facial expression along w/ her question is giving top tier critic energy!🙌😂❤️,” one follower wrote, while another wrote, “Or does she don’t 😂💕😍 lil cute self.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The latest video of Kaavia judging the looks comes one week after Gabrielle shared a different video, which can be seen above, that showed the little one helping with another look, that included a flowing black sleeveless dress. “Tell me what you did with your mom?” Gabrielle asked in the clip before Kaavia replied with, “we did the make-up,” and “lip gloss” and “then the dress” as she lifted the fashion choice. She also showed off “the shoes” she had picked, which was a pair of gold platform heels, and a purse that Gabrielle called “a little fancy number.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-embed">Before Gabrielle shared her outfit moments with Kaavia, she revealed both she and Dwyane <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>split their bills</a> fifty-fifty. “In this household, we split everything fifty-fifty,” she told the&nbsp;Black Millionaires&nbsp;podcast. “But in the other households that each of us have to support, there’s always this like, gorilla on your back, that’s like, ‘You better work, b****, you better work. Oh, you’re going to sleep in?’ You know, somebody might not eat. It’s hard. It’s hard to let that go. So I’m working on that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5JpZqCZkqe2prjLnmSuppmku26wwK6eoayVp3qsrcCvoJplmqqxqLHSZp2apZmhxm671K2doqyjYsOqsMSoZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
