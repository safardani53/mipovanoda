What a special trip.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Last weekend, Vanessa and Cole, 27, exchanged vows in Tulum, Mexico, three years after the newlyweds started dating in 2020. Their love story is a fan-favorite, as fans found out that they met via a Zoom meditation group, the Disney Channel alum previously revealed.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Although they’re happily married now, Vanessa noted in the past that she wasn’t in a rush to tie the knot with Cole. During her interview with Nylon in 2022, the “Sneakernight” singer pointed out that she wasn’t “panicked” anymore about the timeline she had between getting married and having children.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I always thought I would be married at 25, because that’s when my mom got married, and then when that didn’t happen, I was like, ‘Oh, OK. So we’re just going to shift everything back a bit,’” she explained. “I always thought that around 36, 37 is when I would want to have kids, and that still plays. I don’t feel panicked about it</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Vanessa met Cole several months after her breakup from ex-boyfriend <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Austin Butler</b></a> was revealed. The former couple dated for nearly a full decade before calling it quits. The <i>Elvis</i> star, 32, has since moved on with girlfriend <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kaia Gerber</strong></a>, and while Vanessa has not publicly commented on her split from Austin, he was nudged to credit the <i>Gimme Shelter</i> actress for encouraging him to audition for the role of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Elvis Presley</strong></a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I was with my partner at the time,” Austin told The Los Angeles Times in January of this year. “We’d been together for so long, and she had this sort of clairvoyant moment [about me playing Elvis], and so, I really, I owe her a lot for believing in me.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze49xZq%2BZnprAtK2Moaydn5WjwG6%2BxK6loqyVqHq4tdOhZKGhl516tK%2FHqKalZZ2qwKqvwKVkrKyRp8BurdNmrp6clJ67qHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
