Before I started Jessie, I was on a more dramatic route. So it was sort of weird for me, doing Wimpy Kid and then Jessie. I had a lot of fun doing A Sister’s Nightmare.

That was a lot of fun. And it’s funny, because my dad keeps mixing up the movies. He’ll be like, ‘Secrets In The Walls&nbsp;is coming out,’ and I’ll be like, ‘No, Dad.’</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>>> I hate when my dad mixes up my Lifetime movies. It’s the worst. … Can you give us a little background on your character?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>I play Emily. She’s afraid of drowning, so she has lots of nightmares in the movie about drowning. It was so weird for me, because I had to learn how to be able to sink and look like I was drowning. It was intense, but it was kind of cool. I liked it. And now I can sink in my own pool, and everybody’s always like, ‘Peyton, are you OK?’</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><img decoding=async alt=sisters-nightmare-2 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sisters-nightmare-2.jpg width=600 height=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>>> This movie doubles as a mini&nbsp;Gossip Girl&nbsp;reunion with Kelly Rutherford and Matthew Settle. Were you a&nbsp;Gossip Girl&nbsp;fan? I feel like that might have been a little before your time.</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Yeah, I was pretty young, but I was a secret watcher. My parents let me watch it, but if I went out in public and told people I watched it, they were like, ‘What? You’re way too young for that!’ I actually watched it from the beginning, and I loved it. So I was so excited to be working with them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>>> How is Kelly Rutherford as an on-screen mom?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>She’s awesome. She’s so nice, and she’s a mother, too, so she’s just so good. We hung out and talked a lot, she’s really cool.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong>>> Since this movie is so different from what your fans are used to, what are you excited for them to see?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>My dramatic scenes, for sure. I have a lot of crying scenes because my character has night terrors. Nobody’s ever really seen me screaming and crying, so I’m excited for them to see that.</p><h3>WATCH: ‘A Sister’s Nightmare’ Trailer</h3><p id=content-paragraph-16><strong>— Andy Swift</strong><br><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow @AndySwift</a></p><h3>More Lifetime Scoop:</h3><li>‘Witches Of East End’ Preview: Jenna Dewan-Tatum Charms Lifetime Series</li><li>‘Pretty Little Liars’ Stud Chuck Hittinger Goes Dark In Lifetime’s ‘Stalked At 17’</li><li>Lifetime’s ‘Anna Nicole’ Star Donny Boaz: Larry Birkhead Was ‘Beacon Of Light’</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH16e49wZpplo57AtbHRrGSnoZedwa6t0Z5kpaGWmsGqucRmp56xpKS7brjIrKtmoZ6psrPCyJ6uaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
