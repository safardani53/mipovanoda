Leah Messer said she and Jaylan Mobley are on good terms after announcing their split earlier this month.
“While y’all are tripping on what the reason for the breakup is, we’re solid,” the Teen Mom star, 30, wrote via Twitter on Monday, October 17. “Refocusing and transitioning into better days ahead of us.”
Mobley, 26, retweeted the message, which seemingly shuts down speculation that Mobley cheated on Messer."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We will forever have love and respect for each other, and we ask for privacy as we refocus and transition out of this chapter together.”</p><p>The two began dating in August 2021 after meeting at an ESPN event one year earlier. In April, the lovebirds bought a house. “It is even better than we expected. I think every day gets better,” the <a href=#>Hope, Grace and Faith </a>author exclusively told Us in August after moving in with the former NASA intern. “I have nothing to say besides that.”</p><p>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter fans watched Mobley bond with the <a href=#>MTV star’s three daughters</a>, twins Ali and Aleeah, 12, and Adalynn, 9. Messer shares the twins with her first husband, <strong>Corey Simms</strong>, and Addie with her second husband, <strong>Jeremy Calvert</strong>.</p><p>Prior to getting engaged to Mobley, she wed Simms, 32, in October 2010, but they split the following year. The West Virginia native later tied the knot with Calvert, 33, in April 2012, and the pair called it quits in June 2015.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Messer admitted earlier this year that she had <a href=#>concerns about saying “I do”</a> again.</p><p>“For me, I don’t think marriage should change anything. I think it has in the past for me. And I’ve been like, ‘What did I do?’” she exclusively told Us in March. “I think it’s scary. Like, we put a label on it, and it should go one way or the other. And I’m like, ‘That scares me a little bit.’ It does. It’s a huge commitment.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnZWjeq67zKxkpZ2RnXqusdKsnKtln6Wyr7%2BMrqdmmZapsrN5yZqwpZmeYrqwrsuesGaroKG2tXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
