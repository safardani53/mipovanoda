He’d first been diagnosed with lung cancer in 2015, but thought it had gone into remission. “In 2020, I was back in Sweden and I had some kind of acid reflux, I didn’t know what it was so I did an MRI,” he said during a May appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>In Depth with Graham Besinger</a>. “They found that there were a few more tumors around that area. They found one more tumor in the liver, so I was like aw s****, okay.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dolpg-daughter-ida-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The Expendables icon admitted it didn’t take long to sink in. “At that point it started to hit me that this <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was something serious,</a>” he explained. “The surgeon called me and said it had grown, it was too big, it had grown to the size of a small lemon. I asked them how long do I have left, I think he said 2-3 years but I could tell in his voice he thought it was less. I thought that was it for sure.” Emma added that they, “realized it was a lot worse than we thought, they started talking about tumors in the lung, stomach, spine, outside the kidneys.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Dolph-Lundgren-shirtless-Bikini-Fiancee-Emma-mega-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Though he confessed he’d had concerned that steroid use had been involved it the diagnosis, Dolph expressed optimism. “You just appreciate being lucky enough to be alive, and you appreciate every moment there is,” he said at the time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Dolph shares Ida and Greta with his ex wife, interior designer <strong>Anette Qviberg.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BsZp2nnKW1brjUp5ugqpWjeqe1wKeanp1dma62s8etnKtlo6y2rr%2FUoqusZZ2uuLC6zqxkqaCfqby0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
