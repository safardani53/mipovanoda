The Las Vegas Raiders kicked off the 2020 football season with an epic home game win at Allegiant Stadium against the New Orleans Saints. And although most fans were hoping that their star quarterback, Derek Carr, would have the same success as he did in 2016, which was the last time the Raiders made the playoffs, several viewers were more focused on something else: his eyes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The consensus isn't completely clear.</h2><p>If you've ever seen Derek up close, you may have noticed the area around his eyelashes looks rather dark, as if he applied eyeliner earlier that morning. So, obviously, fans and sports enthusiasts alike have questioned it several times in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>Derek has milked the rumor, and even jokingly admitted to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wearing "guyliner" in an EECU commercial</a>, however, he's also flat-out denied it, saying "the lord blessed [him] with great eyelashes" on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dan Patrick Show.</a></p><p>In October 2018, it was also rumored that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Derek cried on the field</a> after getting hurt in a game against the Seattle Seahawks, according to Belly Up Sports. Although it's also unconfirmed if he was actually crying, or if he was simply in pain, we most likely would have noticed smeared eyeliner had he been wearing any.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans have come up with several reasons as to why Derek would be wearing eyeliner in the first place.</h2><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raiders Reddit thread</a>, fans have speculated why the quarterback would be wearing eyeliner in the first place, and the answers are pretty hilarious. Reddit user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">anustart2018</a> simply answered it was "for intimidation" purposes and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>capincus</u></a> backed up this point, saying: "it would be extremely bad a-s for a dude to wear mascara onto a football field without regard to what anyone thought."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Others, however, are commiserating with the star athlete, saying people often think they're wearing eyeliner when they simply have glorious natural lashes. For example, Reddit user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Henne_BadB---h_Weed</u></a> said: "I have thick, long eyelashes too and people just think that about me," before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Slayer_Of_Anubis</u></a> chimed in, saying: "I understand, Derek. People ask me the same thing all the time."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It seems like we all may owe Derek an apology for assuming he was wearing eye makeup and for overlooking his natural beauty. However, if he is actually resorting to eyeliner for intimidation purposes, we totally respect his decision. TBH, if he were to release a line of eye makeup, we wouldn't be totally against buying into it —&nbsp;he looks great.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxllJq%2FpreMnJirql2ssqK%2BjJ6wnqSZo7Kz</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
