There’s also an epic twist happening. The artists who were saved in the battles are competing in a 4-way knockout. The winner of this knockout will be determined by America’s vote. The first knockout of the night is between Team<strong> John Legend’s</strong> <strong>Thunderstorm Artis</strong> and <strong>Mandi Castillo</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Thunderstorm performs John’s own song “Preach,” while Mandi goes with a more modern version of “Stand By Me.” <strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong> raves that Thunderstorm has the “coolest tone” but Mandi “came to win a little bit more.” John noted the same thing about Thunderstorm’s tone and said Mandi’s performance was “just flawless. The winner of this knockout is Mandi Castillo. However, <strong>Nick Jonas</strong> steals Thunderstorm and says he feels like the “luckiest man.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Next up is Team Nick’s <strong>Arei Moon</strong> and <strong>Jon Mullins</strong>. Arei slays her rendition of<strong> Alicia Keys’</strong> hit “You Don’t Know My Name” and Jon wows with his performance of<strong> Ed Sheeran’s</strong> “Thinking Out Loud.” These two are pretty even when it comes to their performances. Nick has another tough choice to make. The winner of this knockout: Arei Moon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Team Kelly’s <strong>Tayler Green</strong> and <strong>Micah Iverson</strong> face off next. Micah takes a risk with his unique performance of <strong>Halsey’s</strong> “Graveyard” while Tayley stuns with her powerful rendition of <strong>Cyndi Lauper’s</strong> “Time After Time.” <strong>Blake Shelton</strong> tells Micah that his song choice didn’t allow him to “vocally soar.” John agrees with Blake and calls Tayler “mesmerizing.” The winner of this knockout is <strong>Micah Iverson</strong>. Kelly also keeps <strong>Mandi Thomas</strong> on her team after a knockout.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Team Nick’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Allegra Miles</strong></a> and <strong>Jacob Miller</strong> take the stage next. Jacob switches things up with his rendition of <strong>Post Malone’s</strong> “Better Now.” Allegra leaves the coaches speechless with her performance of <strong>Sia’s</strong> “Chandelier.” All the coaches praise Allegra and Jacob, but Blake tells Nick that “Allegra is your chance to win The Voice.” The winner of this knockout is Allegra Miles.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Team Blake’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cedrice</strong></a> and <strong>Toneisha Harris</strong> go head-to-head with <strong>Rihanna</strong> songs. Cedrice slays her rendition of “Love on the Brain,” while Toneisha effortlessly takes on “Diamonds.” John declares that Toneisha has the&nbsp;“quality of someone who should be in the finale.” Nick agrees with John about Toneisha being finale-worthy. Kelly says that both contestants could be in the finale. They’re both that good. The winner of this knockout is Toneisha Harris. But Kelly comes in and steals Cedrice!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Now it’s time for the 4-way knockout between <strong>Nelson Cade III</strong>, <strong>Michael Williams</strong>, <strong>Todd Michael Hall</strong>, and <strong>Samantha Howell.</strong> After their performances, it’s down to America to decide who moves forward. The result of this first-ever 4-way knockout will be revealed during the first live show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH11e5FpZq2glWLDsLXCnmSfoZ6WuW63zaiapKelqcBuwMeupZ2doqjBsL7MZpirrJmoerSt1Z6bZqqVmK6xew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
