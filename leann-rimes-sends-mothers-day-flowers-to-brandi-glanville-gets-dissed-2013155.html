Country singer Rimes, 30, is now stepmother to <strong>Mason</strong> and <strong>Jake</strong>, Glanville's sons with ex <a href=#><strong>Eddie Cibrian</strong></a>. As a peace offering of sorts to her frequent enemy, it appears that Rimes sent the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star a bouquet of flowers on Mother's Day.</p><p>But the twosome quickly bickered — more passive aggressively than usual — about the gesture via Twitter. "I thanked @leannrimes on twitter4 my flowers," Glanville, 40, <a href=#>wrote</a> on Monday, May 13, explaining that any larger thank you wasn't really possible or appropriate. "Our relationship is that we still don't even say hi at baseball," the Bravo star and bestselling author said of the often-frosty Little League games both women have attended for the boys. "I don't have her number — that's it."</p><p>Rimes then addressed the situation when a follower pointed out Glanville's tweets. "This was actually the first acknowledgment of my gesture I was made aware of," she <a href=#>wrote</a>. "I didn't see anything else sent to me."</p><p>She also made a cryptic reference to "how twisted" things can get. "It never ceases to amaze me," she <a href=#>tweeted</a>. Later, responding to a follower's comment about "putting up" with "such nonsense," she added, "As you can see, I don't 'put up' w/ it."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Mother's Day, not surprisingly, is clearly a touchy subject for the rivals. Rimes' involvement in Glanville's sons' lives has been a sore subject in the past, and frequent fodder for their feuds on Twitter. "I don't think we'll be friends, but I hope we can coexist peacefully," Glanville <a href=#>told Access Hollywood</a> earlier this year. "Once she has a child of her own, I think she will understand boundaries and what's respectful to do and how to handle things a little better."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGalnZGju26%2ByKacrGWjmrulv4ympq2glafAbrDAsmSfpJ%2BssrO%2FjK2mZpqilrultYygo5qmpp65rbGMoJytq12ZtrS%2FxJ1ka2hhaH52gY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
