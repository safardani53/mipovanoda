If the answer is no, then it’s probably best to avoid gifting it,” David joked.</p><p>Though most of us would never dream of giving a risqué gift, he later revealed there had been sexual misconduct grievance raised over one gag gift.</p><p>He said: “One female employee gifted a male colleague a Borat thong and it was then suggested that he should wear it.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>For those that are still unsure what to get, it is always best to check your HR policy first and rely on basic presents – such as a new office mug.</p><p>Thankfully, you still have time to get a new present – even if you’ve messed up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/business-men-women-glasses-champagne-863362155.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/office-staff-enjoying-christmas-party-863362304.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FtcGpxZGl%2FcL%2FEnKmerF2orq%2FAwGauqKqbYrSqstOsZKGqXZrFsbHRrWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
