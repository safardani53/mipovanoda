The network <a href=#>renewed Yellowstone for season 5</a> in February, and Grimes knew it was special from the start.</p><p>“Kayce Dutton, in Yellowstone is a dream. I couldn’t have imagined it better myself than if I sat down and asked, ‘What would be the perfect character to play?’” he told <a href=#>As If Magazine</a> in the fall of 2018. “I’m literally playing it.”</p><p>The Magnificent Seven actor gushed about the role once again in January, telling <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>, “When you’re a little boy and you want to be an actor, what are some things you want to play? A cowboy, a soldier.”</p><p>He added: “It’s kind of all of the dream roles wrapped into one. He’s just an emotionally complex guy but also a badass. It’s all good stuff.”</p><p>While Grimes has always wanted to act, his <a href=#>passion for music</a> is a close second when it comes to his career goals.</p><p>“Acting was the first thing I knew I wanted to do artistically, and I had a lot of ambition,” the Happiness for Beginners star previously told As If. “Music came from a place of not being able to satisfy the need to act, so I started playing music in church when I was really young. … Music is very important to me, but I’m not ambitious about it. I’ve played in bands in L.A., but the moment the band picked up momentum I backed off to not lose sight of acting.”</p><p>That focus paid off with Grimes and <a href=#>his Yellowstone costars</a> earning a <a href=#>2022 SAG Awards nomination</a> for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. The show lost to Succession at the February awards show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The El Camino Christmas actor reflected on his life during an interview with ET in January, saying, “I’m happy with my life, you know. I wake up every day and feel so lucky. … I get to live where I live and be married to my wife. So yeah, sure, I’m proud of myself.”</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Grimes:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkxqa4y6iurKyfo7K0ecuuop5ll6e2rrHSZmxmrJieu6i%2FjK2mZqOepMRw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
