Then something happened,” the England native explained. “I sang this song in Wembley [<a href=#>at the U.K. tribute for Hawkins</a>] when we did this a couple weeks ago and it’s a song written by a young man called Freddie Mercury. And I wasn’t going to do it, but then I got a message from Alison Hawkins. And she said, ‘Brian, I want you to do this song. I want everybody to do this song for me. I want you to do it for me and Taylor because it was our song. It was played at our wedding. It was our wedding album.’”</p><p class=x_p1>May added that Alison, <a href=#>who tied the knot with Taylor in 2005</a>, requested that the guitarist “get everybody to sing it as my gift to the love of my life,” before asking the crowd: “Shall we do it? Everybody needs to do it with me though, OK? If you don’t know the words you can hum, alright?”</p><p class=x_p1>Following the emotional performance, Alison took the stage with her two daughters — Annabelle, 13, and Everleigh, 8 — to blow a kiss of appreciation to the audience.</p><p class=x_p1>“Love of My Life” was one of 50 songs to be played at the six-hour-long concert, with bandmate Grohl, 53, taking the stage <a href=#>to open the show</a>, which took place at&nbsp;Los Angeles’ Kia Forum stadium.</p><p class=x_p1>“This <a href=#>is the hometown, s—t</a>, so you gotta make it loud and turn it up,” the singer said, adding that Taylor had an ability to “make you f—king smile and dance and laugh and sing.”</p><p class=x_p1>“What we really wanted to do was <a href=#>to pay tribute to Taylor in a way that</a> you could sort of spend some time in his musical mind,” he told the audience. “Which could be a pretty terrifying place, actually.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Brian-May-Plays-Wedding-Song-Tribute-Concert-Taylor-Hawkins-Widow-0001.jpg><p class=x_p1>In addition to the Foo Fighters and May,<a href=#><strong> Joan Jett</strong></a> and Blink-182’s <a href=#><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a> performed “Cherry Bomb” and “Bad Reputation,” while<a href=#><strong> Miley Cyrus</strong></a> sang a rendition of “Photograph” with Def Leppard’s<strong> Joe Elliot</strong>. <a href=#><strong>Pink</strong></a> also made an appearance with Queen’s <strong>Roger Taylor</strong> and May, serving as frontwoman for “Somebody to Love.”</p><p class=x_p1><a href=#><strong>Alanis Morissette</strong></a>, who the California native played with before teaming up with Grohl in the 1990s, also surprised fans with a heartfelt rendition of “You Oughta Know.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=x_p1>Hawkins died in March at age 50.
