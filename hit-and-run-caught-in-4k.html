In the video, a woman emerges from a car that seems to be a silver BMW 3 series sedan and is holding a backpack.</p><p>Her car, which has damage to the left side of the vehicle along with its hood, appears to have hit a dark-blue-colored pickup truck. The woman initially looks like she's approaching the truck's driver, but then soon crosses over the street and begins to walk away from the accident scene.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @jhettlynwolfe</span></figure><p>Someone asks the woman: "You wanna ride?

She was wearing a black Adidas track jacket with white stripes.</p><p>The person recording the video attempts to follow her with the camera as she runs down the street. There are several reasons why the woman could've ultimately decided to run away instead of just facing the music.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Presumably, she probably thought she would've been in a lot more trouble if the cops showed up and filed a report. Was she driving without a license? Was the car stolen? Did she have some contraband in her backpack she didn't want 5-0 to get a hold of? Did she not have insurance?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Or maybe she just didn't want her parents to find out she wrecked the bimmer and thought it'd be better to go and start a new life somewhere else?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insurify</a> also writes that 4.6 out of every 10,000 motorists have at least one hit-and-run violation on their record, which, in the grand scheme of things, is a pretty low number, when you consider that there are a whopping 6 million auto accidents that occur in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">United States every single year</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>TikTokers who saw the clip were cracking up at the young woman's response: "She heard 'you want a ride?' and was like say lessssss"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And as it turns out, the crash was recorded and uploaded by different users from multiple angles, which shows just how many freakin' people are on TikTok these days, and how quick folks are to whip out their phones.
