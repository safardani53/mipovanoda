Source: TikTok | @aviles1017Love or hate Subway, there is something special about watching the employee from behind the counter make your sandwich to your exact liking and specifications.
From picking your bread to the type of protein you want to be placed in it, and all of the additional toppings/accouterments placed on your meal, to the condiments/dressings spritzed on top, it's an experience."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I js wanted a Sandwich bro ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòí</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Ashleybbyüíñüåº" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Ashleybbyüíñüåº</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @aviles1017</span></figure><p>She writes in a text overlay of the video: "This lady fell asleep on my sandwich," as she records the employee sprinkling what looks like oregano on the meal as she lightly begins to doze off over the sub.</p><p>As they nod off over the counter, they mush the spice container into the sandwich, their head keeling closer and closer to the containers of toppings and sauces before them. It's but slightly funny and heartbreaking at the same time, leading many to question the cause of it.</p><p>It doesn't take very long for their hat to dig into the sandwich, too, and then it becomes obvious that they're completely passed out and have fully fallen asleep on the meal.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @aviles1017</span></figure><p>The video had a litany of different responses. There were some folks who expressed concern that the employee was overworked and was more than likely working multiple jobs in order to make ends meet that her body just couldn't keep up.</p><p>That could be one possibility that appears to be backed by both anecdotal and statistical evidence gathered from surveys. A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vox</a> article written by a journalist who had to forego writing and took up working in fast food thoroughly discussed the heightened levels of burnout that they weren't prepared for.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC also reported that Panera loses "nearly 100%"</a> of its workforce every single year and is constantly hiring new workers as a result.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @aviles1017</span></figure><p>However, there were other TikTokers who joked about the employee snoozing over the sandwich, remarking that the music playing over the Subway's loudspeakers didn't help matters either, which forced the woman into a pity of sleepy despair.</p><p>Another quipped, "She just seein if it smell fresh"</p><p>However there were others who thought that the woman wasn't falling asleep because she was overworked, but because she was stoned to the bone off of some type of drug/narcotics.</p><p>"Heroine is no joke," one person wrote.</p><p>Another said: "All the innocent ppl be like ‚Äúomg she‚Äôs over worked‚Äù 'poor baby so over tired' bruh she on oneeeeee"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @aviles1017</span></figure><p>If you've ever interacted with regular opioid users, you have probably become accustomed to them <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"nodding out"</a> mid-discussion. It's a common sight: the inebriated person will be engaged with you mid-conversation, or texting on their phone, and their head will start to droop slightly before they ricochet themselves up into position, suddenly alert.</p><p>What do you think the cause of the Subway worker's sudden sleepiness is? Have you ever been in a situation where the person preparing your food passed out on it? Thankfully she was cooking some pasta over an active stove top.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMKjw8CyZLCnoqCys3nFmqOlq12WwK2xxKlkqKZdqK6vsNaimqE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
