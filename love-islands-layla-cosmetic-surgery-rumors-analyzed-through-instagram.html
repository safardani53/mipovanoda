Some of the candid stars include Islanders <a href=#>Tanyel Revan</a> and Anna-May.</p><p>Although Love Island bombshell Layla has not publicly admitted to having had any cosmetic surgery, her Instagram follows do include a few London-based clinics that specialize in lip filler. However, as Layla has not spoken out on the topic, we must remind readers that correlation does not equal causation and sometimes a rumor is just that until confirmed.</p><p>The bombshell’s first Instagram post was back in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2013</a>.</p><p>Whether Layla has had cosmetic surgery or not, however, she looks great, and fans have taken to Twitter to compliment the bombshell on her looks.</p><p>One <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted</a>: “Sanam is pretty & Layla has great boobs <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">#loveisland</a>“</p><p>Another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a>: “Why are people dissing Layla, she’s actually well pretty, I would love to look like her.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Layla is pretty <a href=#>#LoveIsland</a></p>— Martheline (@_Martheline) <a href=#>February 13, 2023</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-bombshell-is-set-to-cause-a-stir-as-she-cracks-on-with-will>The bombshell is set to cause a stir as she cracks on with Will</h2><p>Layla was sent into the Love Island villa to cause a stir, and that’s exactly what she did. She gravitated towards Will from the very beginning and, last we checked in, the two were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seen</a> having a chat and getting quite flirty.</p><p>“He makes you feel really comfortable and we just got on really well,” Layla said of her new BFF. And the feelings weren’t one-sided as Will asked where he should take her on a date.</p><p>Will and Jessie seemed like one of the strongest couples before Casa Amor, but 9 seasons in, we all know by now to expect the unexpected.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If Will kisses Layla then love is dead <a href=#>#loveisland</a></p>— Franki ♓︎ (@frxnkiElizabeth) <a href=#>February 14, 2023</a></figure>View Tweet<p>WATCH LOVE ISLAND ON ITV2 EVERY DAY AT 9 PM</p><p><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>INSTAGRAM</a><strong>, </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>FACEBOOK</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>TWITTER</a> AND <a href=# rel=nofollow>TIKTOK</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfma61tc2gZqWnppp6qr%2FLmqWdZ5ykw6Z5yKyjmqaUqHqtrdilmGabn6i6psDInGSsraKcsrPFjKuspqeiqHqiusClsLOdlGLBqb7Orp6hZZmjwLWtxquYpg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
