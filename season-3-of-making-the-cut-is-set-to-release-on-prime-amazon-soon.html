Furthermore, they will be required to produce two looks: an ‘accessible look’ and a ‘runway look.’ Every week, they must display their outfits on the fashion catwalk, which will be set against stunning scenery in Los Angeles.&nbsp;The judges will choose the eventual winner, who will get $1 million and further possibilities to promote their brand in the fashion industry, based on their work.</p><p>The show will also feature “new brand collaborations, including an activewear challenge with iconic brand Champion, and expanded collections from each week’s winning designers, giving fans and customers even more opportunities to shop in Amazon Fashion’s Making the Cut store,” according to the show’s description.&nbsp;In addition, the new season will include some classic Los Angeles settings such as Beverly Hills’ Rodeo Drive, the unusual desert scenery of Vasquez Rocks, and a rooftop of one of Downtown LA’s numerous skyscrapers with panoramic views of the city skyline.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Making-The-Cut-2-1.jpg alt="Making The Cut" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Furthermore, the event will be judged by Nicole Richie, creative director of House of Harlow 1960, and Jeremy Scott, fashion pop phenomenon and creative director of Moschino.&nbsp;Pop singers Chloe x Halle, A-List stylist Jason Bolden, designer TikToker, and model Wisdom Kaye will all make cameos in the evening.
