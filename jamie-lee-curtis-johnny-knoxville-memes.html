Because the pop culture gods every so often bless us, two of our silver-haired unproblematic faves â€” aka Jamie Lee Curtis and Johnny Knoxville â€” have once again been thrust into the mainstream limelight.

In a February 2022 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show</a> guest-hosted by <a href=#>Jay Leno</a>, Rachel explained that Johnny debuted his au naturale hair in the middle of filming Jackass Forever. This was after production was shut down because of COVID-19. Hilariously, she called him "Silver Foxville."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>"I think me and the internet both agree that he has a strong resemblance to Jamie Lee Curtis," she said. "I thought I was on the set of Halloween." If we had been on the set of Jackass Forever, we would have kept our eyes peeled for <a href=#>Michael Myers</a>.</p><p>Here are the best Jamie Lee Curtis and Johnny Knoxville doppelgÃ¤nger memes the internet has to offer.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Freaky Friday' (2022)</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter/@Smashby17</span></figure><p>This is the tweet that broke us.
