He revealed one needs to do something for themselves, and he always had a hobby to keep him occupied.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ez-10 class=ez-video-placeholder-marker></span><p>Goode&nbsp;further explained&nbsp;that he goes fishing when his children go to school. Similarly, his wife, Dymoke, liked to ride since childhood, so she got back to doing that. The couple likes to have some fun apart from their everyday life, confessed the actor.</p><p>You have to have something for yourself. I’ve always had a hobby. When the kids go to school, I go fishing. Sophie used to ride a lot when she was a child, and she recently got back into that. So we have a bit of fun on the side.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>The Imitation Game&nbsp;star also declared that a celebrity’s married life could be equally&nbsp;mundane&nbsp;as it could be for the rest of us, as he jokingly added about the “happily boring” life with his better half.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>A Happy Family of Five</h2><p>In a&nbsp;2014 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview&nbsp;</a>with&nbsp;HitFix, Goode revealed the couple got married after their second child’s birth. During the interaction, the actor also jokingly said that “our wives own us.”&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In their fifteen years of togetherness, the pair is blessed with three&nbsp;beautiful children&nbsp;— two daughters and a son. The eldest daughter, Matilda Eve Goode, was born in March 2009. Another baby girl, Teddie Eleanor Rose Goode, joined their family in August 2015, and later in August 2015, the couple welcomed their youngest and only son, Ralph Goode.&nbsp;</p><p>The 42-year-old actor believes in maintaining a healthy work-life balance to spend quality time with his family. In September 2018 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview </a>with&nbsp;Bustle,&nbsp;when asked about his massive potential of stardom beyond the borders, Goode expressed his unwillingness to leave the family.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The&nbsp;Downton Abbey&nbsp;star opened up about not liking the idea of being away from his wife and children. He said he occasionally needs to go abroad because of his&nbsp;professional commitments, but he considers himself lucky to be able to mix work and family.</p><p>I have three children and a lovely wife and I just don’t like being away from them. Of course, needs must occasionally. But I’m very lucky. I’ve been able to mix work and family.</p><p>Apart from that, Dymoke and Goode have remained low-key regarding their children.&nbsp;<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com//uploads/images/Matthew-William-Goodes-Daughter-Matilda-Eve-Goode.jpg></p><p>The children rarely make any public appearances, and the actor hardly&nbsp;shares anything about his family life on his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">social media</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnnZbBtbTEsGSgp5%2BZsm7DyJ%2BcZ6Ckork%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
