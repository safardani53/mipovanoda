Grimaldi’s appearance at Viall’s rehearsal comes just days after <i>Bachelor</i> fans watched the hunky reality TV vet propose to the Canadian special-needs teacher, 29, in a Finnish winter wonderland on the Monday, March 13, season 21 finale.</p><p>In the latest issue of <i>Us Weekly</i>, <a href=#>an insider says that the couple are making their relationship a priority</a> after Viall popped the question with a stunning 3.75-carat diamond Neil Lane engagement ring. “Nick and Vanessa want to be in it for the long run,” the source tells <i>Us</i>.</p><p>During <a href=#>a March 14 appearance on <i>Good Morning America</i></a><i></i>, the duo discussed the “ups and downs” of their romance. “It feels great,” Viall said. “It’s very difficult to try to keep that secret, and it’s been a long time for me in <i>Bachelor</i> world. It’s a good feeling to be engaged, to have Vanessa and have this kind of chapter in my life come to an end.”</p><p>Added Grimaldi: “Like any relationship, you know, you have your ups and downs. Although we had tough conversations, we had a lot of fun and light conversations, so it was important for me to know we were going to be able to get past those hard conversations.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>The pair, who appeared on the morning show via video conference from L.A., also revealed that they haven’t set a wedding date yet. “One thing I really appreciate about our relationship is we’re going to take this one step at a time and be realistic,” Viall said. “Last night … was our first time having dinner at a restaurant in public. … I think there’s some things we want to do as a couple and some normal things and, you know, we’re going to move things along. We’ll worry about setting a date down the road.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavmZ6awLStjKCpoqWRobGqecmooKerXaO2pLeMr6CapJxirrV5w5qlnKGenHq4tdOhZK2glWLAta3RrGSwbGdngXF%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
