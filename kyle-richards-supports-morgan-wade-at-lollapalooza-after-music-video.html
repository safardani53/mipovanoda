(The video drops next week.)</p><p class=p1>“I heard Morgan on the radio,” Richards <a href=#>said in an Instagram teaser posted on Friday</a>. “I heard ‘Wilder Days’ and then I went to all the others and I was like, ‘Wow, this girl is blowing me away with her voice and lyrics and I looked her up on Instagram and I was like, ‘Oh, the tattoos and everything. I wasn’t expecting all that.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kyle-Richards-Supports-Morgan-Wade-at-Lollapalooza-After-Music-Video-Collaboration-promo.jpg><p class=p1>She added at the time: “So I followed her and then I <a href=#>kept listening to her music</a> on repeat and then she sent me a DM asking me why I was following her.”</p><p class=p1>Wade chimed in to explain that she did not expect to<a href=#> connect with “somebody from Beverly Hills.”&nbsp;</a>She said, “My friends freaked out and I was like, ‘Oh, OK.’ We thought it would be a good idea to kind of poke fun at that and troll the trolls a little bit.”</p><p class=p1><i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>confirmed last month that Richards and husband<a href=#> <strong>Mauricio Umansky</strong></a> — who share<a href=#> daughters Alexia, 27, Sophia, 23, and Portia, 15</a> — had <a href=#>separated after two decades of marriage</a>.

However, yes, we have had a rough year,” Richards and Umansky, 53, <a href=#>wrote in a joint Instagram statement</a>, denying the claims. “The <a href=#>most challenging one of our marriage</a>. But we both <a href=#>love and respect each other</a> tremendously.
