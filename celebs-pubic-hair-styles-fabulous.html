Opting for full pubic hair has been gaining popularity since 2013 when Gwyneth Paltrow said she favoured the “70s vibe” of the natural look.
Over the years there have been Brazilians (waxed but leaving a “landing strip”), Hollywoods (all hair waxed off) and even vajazzles (decorated with gems). But New York gynaecologist Dr Eden Fromberg told Vogue she has seen lots more patients wanting fuller hair downstairs."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now it was taking charge of my body and getting rid of it made me feel like a sophisticated adult.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BUSHGRAPHIC-1.jpg><p>As I grew more confident and comfortable, my pubes became an extension of my bold personal style.For a while, I was really into dressing like one-hit-wonder girl band Shampoo, who were famous for their bratty baby doll look. I shaved my pubes into a cute love heart to match.</p><p>Next, I experimented with removing all the hair and decorating with stick-on gemstones, twinkling metallic temporary tattoos, or scratch ’n’ sniff cherry-scented ones.<br>My nether regions looked like they were heading to a carnival. As a long-term fan of rainbow-hued hair dye, I once tried colouring my pubes too, using a product called Betty.</p><p>The process involved combing through an apparently beaver-friendly bleach, then wrapping your crotch in clingfilm for half an hour to keep the heat in while it developed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BUSHGRAPHIC-2.jpg><p>Thankfully the mixture didn’t get painfully hot — there weren’t any bush fires. Finally, you had to apply a hot pink paste. At first, I had the flamingo-coloured foo-foo of my dreams. But a week later, the dye washed out — leaving a rusty blonde tuft with grown-through roots.</p><p>It looked horrendous. I went back to bald straight away. Some people might assume that I alter my pubic hair to try to please men, but that’s never been my motivation. It has always primarily been something I’ve done for myself. I view it as a fun form of creativity and secret self-expression that makes me feel empowered and gives me a grin every time I catch a peek when I nip to the loo.</p><p>Obviously, lovers do get to view it if they’re lucky. Most guys I’ve dated have seemed delighted, although one did ask me to go au naturel and grow the hair out. He thought my bare look was uncomfortably childlike. I feel the opposite — ungroomed pubic hair reminds me of being an awkward adolescent with hair sprouting out of its own accord.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BUSHGRAPHIC-3.jpg><p>I did try to embrace a full bush of short ’n’ curlies for him, but I hated it. To me, pubic styling and decoration is an unashamed, joyful celebration of my personality and my sexuality. It’s not about looking like the women in porn, it’s about unashamedly looking like me, proudly adorned.</p><p>While I’m not emotionally attached to the fuzz elsewhere on my body, styling my pubes is an act of self-love. I like the sensation of smooth skin too — it feels better during sexual play.</p><p>I’ve let boyfriends shave me themselves in the past. Because it requires such delicacy and trust, it can be a very sensual, bonding experience.</p><p>As a sex educator, I hear from umpteen young women worried that theirs don’t match those they’ve seen in explicit films, who want to change anything from waxing their pubes to getting plastic surgery in order to match the unrealistic images they’ve seen. It’s heartbreaking.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p>Brook, the sexual health charity for whom I’m an ambassador, just launched a campaign to help combat this by showing how different all sorts of perfectly normal privates can look.</p><p>To any young women wondering whether to “mow” down below: your own pleasure, not outside pressure, should be the only influence on what to do with hair down there.</p><p>I’ll always be a dye-hard believer in that — even though personally, I won’t be voting for bush.</p><ul><li><strong>Alix Fox co-hosts BBC Radio 1’s Unexpected Fluids real-life sex stories show, and answers listeners’ X-rated questions on The Modern</strong></li></ul><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Laila Rouass disgusts Loose Women panel by revealing fiancé Ronnie O'Sullivan cuts his pubes in their garden with scissors</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5VyaGlwZWV8pLHLnpmsZaCqr6qvjKGYoqpdqMG6uMSsZJ%2BZkqq5sMHSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
