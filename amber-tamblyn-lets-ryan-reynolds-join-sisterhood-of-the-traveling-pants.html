One of the most beautiful performances this year: @americaferrera in @barbiethemovie.”</p><p>Ferrera, 39, reacted to Reynold’s post, writing, “😘 @vancityreynolds (But you still can’t borrow the pants, sorry.)”</p><p>Tamblyn, Ferrera, Lively and Bledel, 42, have remained close since starring in 2005’s The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Based on a book series by <strong>Ann Brashares</strong>, the film follows a group of friends as they take turns sharing a pair of jeans that mysteriously fit them all while spending a summer apart. The film also spawned a 2008 sequel.</p><p>The exchange between Reynolds and his wife’s costars began when Lively uploaded several <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> pics from their NYC reunion while also gushing about Ferrera’s performance in Barbie. “I was so happy to celebrate my denim sister @americaferrera. She’s the heart and soul of @barbiethemovie because she’s the heart and soul of everything she’s a part of,” Lively wrote. “I’ve known [America] for 20 years. Since I was 16. I’ve watched her live, grow, soar, fall, make, break, push, fight, win, create, forge, disrupt, way make, lead, lead, lead.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blake-Lively-Praises-America-Ferrera-After-Sisterhood-Cast-Reunion-6.jpg><p>Ferrera stars as Gloria, a mother who helps <strong>Margot Robbie</strong>’s Barbie navigate the real world and teaches her the ups and downs of being a modern-day woman, in the <strong>Greta Gerwig</strong>-directed film “That speech she gives as Gloria felt as close to real as anything I’ve ever seen on screen. Because that’s who she is,” Lively said of her friend’s performance. “She’s that spectacular, passionate, inspiring and full of heart in her own life.”</p><p>She continued: “I can’t wait to watch her sweep awards up across her living room floor. No one deserves it more … for a lifetime of brilliant work. It’s one of my life’s honors to witness her show so many women not only what’s possible, but HOW it’s done. I love you sister. Always. Pants = Love. Love your sisters. Love yourself.”</p><p>Ferrera thanked Lively for her kind words in the post’s comments, writing, “🥹 When your girl gives good hype. I love you forever sis 💕.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Blake-Lively-Praises-America-Ferrera-After-Sisterhood-Cast-Reunion-2.jpg><p>The cast’s latest reunion has left fans hoping to see the group back on screen together. While a third installment in the series (possibly based on the fifth book, Sisterhood Everlasting) is not currently in the works, Lively told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight</a> in April 2018 that she thinks another sequel “could really happen.” She explained: “I think that people who love the movie want to see it. So, I mean, fans have gotten bigger movies made.”</p><p>That same month, Bledel revealed during an appearance on <a href=# rel=noopener>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> that she and the cast “just pitched a third movie,” adding, “I hope it comes together. It would be so great.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJimmpWnerWtzJujsqZdobK1v4yrsJqmXaeyurrOpZusZZqktq950qKqrZ2inbywsIyonWasmJp6tb7Ar5yloZ6cerGtza2qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
