However, he stepped away from his role in 2021 amidst a racism controversy that made major headlines. The drama went down as season 25 of The Bachelor was airing, and contestant&nbsp;<strong>Rachael Kirkconnell</strong> got called out for attending a racist, antebellum-themed party while in college. While discussing the backlash during an interview, Chris glossed over Rachael’s actions and even defended her, leading him to be <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called out</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bachelors-new-host-abc-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>At the time, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Chris decided</a> not to host&nbsp;After the Final Rose for season 25, and then <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>stepped aside</a> from hosting the subsequent season of The Bachelorette and&nbsp;Bachelor in Paradise. In June 2021, he announced that he would be <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>leaving the franchise</a> for good.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>However, the series took some time to find a new, permanent replacement. Seasons 17 and 18 of&nbsp;The Bachelorette were hosted by show alum,&nbsp;<strong>Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Tayshia Adams</strong>. Meanwhile, season 7 of&nbsp;Bachelor in Paradise had a rotating set of hosts, including&nbsp;<strong>David Spade, Lance Bass</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Lil Jon</strong>. Now, they’ve found the person who will step into Chris’s shoes in a more full-time role.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FxZqOdo6iybrzApaSeql2ptaZ5wZqaoZ2cpL9utM6sq2abmKe2tHnHmqmroaOku26x16KraA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
