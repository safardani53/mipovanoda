“He is my absolute everything in my heart,” Gomez wrote in an Instagram comment in December 2023, responding to a post about dating speculation. “He [has] been the best thing that’s ever happened to me. The end. … He’s still better than anyone I’ve been with. Facts.”
Gomez seemingly soft-launched their relationship several hours later, uploading an Instagram Story selfie of her cuddling with a mystery man and another snap that showed her wearing a silver “B” ring."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(Multiple outlets have since reported that Gomez and Blanco are officially dating. <i>Us Weekly </i>has reached out to Gomez for comment.)</p><p class=p1>While Blanco (real name Benjamin Levin) has yet to address his rumored relationship status, he’s known Gomez since 2015.

Blanco’s résumé also includes tracks with two of Gomez’s exes: <strong>Justin Bieber</strong> and <strong>The Weeknd</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Who-Is-Benny-Blanco-5-Things-to-Know-About-Selena-Gomez-s-Rumored-New-Boyfriend-3.jpg><h3 class=p8><b>How Did Benny Blanco Get Started in the Music Industry?</b></h3><p class=p1>After Blanco graduated from high school in 2006, he moved to Brooklyn, New York, and happened upon a rowdy party scene alongside rapper Spank Rock. They quickly bonded, releasing a <i>Bangers & Cash</i> EP that caught the attention of <strong>Dr. Luke</strong>. Luke subsequently took Blanco under his wing.</p><p class=p1>“I didn’t know anything about songwriting. All my beats were, like, 40 seconds long,” Blanco told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>The New York Times </i></a>in 2018<i>. </i>“I couldn’t sit down and play a concert for you or really wow you on any instrument. … What I can do is meet an artist, know what type of song I think we should make and be their therapist, make everyone feel comfortable.”</p><h3 class=p8><b>What Does Benny Blanco Think of His Career?</b></h3><p class=p1>“I wouldn’t consider myself anything. I think I’m a loser,” Blanco confessed to <a href=# rel=noopener><i>NME</i></a> in April 2021. “I don’t think there’s any world where I’d say, ‘Yeah, man, I’m a hitmaker.’ I’m the guy who comes in and tries to approach music from a place of true feeling and emotion and really giving it my all because if I’m not, then what am I doing in life?”</p><p class=p1>He explained that he tries to make music that “doesn’t sound like what’s being played” on the radio but instead fits each individual artist.</p><h3 class=p8><b>Has Benny Blanco Worked With Selena Gomez Before?</b></h3><p class=p1>Blanco and Gomez first crossed paths in 2015, collaborating on her songs “Same Old Love” and “Kill Em With Kindness.” After reuniting on “I Can’t Get Enough” four years later, Blanco worked with Gomez again earlier this year. He assisted in the production of her pop music return, “Single Soon.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Who-Is-Benny-Blanco-5-Things-to-Know-About-Selena-Gomez-s-Rumored-New-Boyfriend-4.jpg><h3 class=p8><b>What Has Selena Gomez Said About Benny Blanco?</b></h3><p class=p1>In a November 2023 <a href=# rel=noopener>teaser</a> for her <i>Selena + Chef: Home for the Holidays </i>special, Gomez hinted that <a href=#>she had a new crush</a>.
