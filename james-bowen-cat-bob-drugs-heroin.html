I felt I wanted it to end. I started looking for an escape again and I started using <a href=#>heroin </a>once more.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Film</h2></p><p>Gradually, James got hooked on the class-A drug which kills more people than any other illegal substance in Britain.</p><p>It cost him his planned ­marriage to fiancée Monika Hertes and almost his “sanity”.</p><p>By last summer he was taking ­heroin every day and was back to the state he was in before he met Bob.</p><h2>Cold turkey on Bangkok streets</h2><p>James was racked by guilt for ­letting down his family and friends, and the thousands of fans still following his social media pages.</p><p>Most of all, he knew he had let down Bob.</p><p>“I wouldn’t have gone on the heroin if he had been around,” James tells The Sun.</p><p>Finally, at the end of last year, he decided to quit.</p><p>The plan was to go to a rehabilitation centre in <a href=#>Thailand</a>, but when he got there in November James ­discovered there had been a mix-up about the funding and he had to leave after only two days.</p><p>The next thing James knew, he was going “cold turkey” on the streets of capital city Bangkok.</p><p>And even though his hip bones had crumbled due to all the years sleeping rough in London, this proved to be his toughest moment.</p><p>James says: “I ended up doing a straight-up detox on the streets of Bangkok. It was the hardest thing I have ever done.”</p><p>All alone in a ­foreign land, he had no painkillers and no money for ­anywhere to stay.</p><p>“I had sweats, cramps — hot and cold, never comfortable. The headaches are the worst,” he explains.</p><p>Realising he could not cope on the bustling city’s incredibly humid streets, James started messaging everyone he knew back home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NINTCHDBPICT000266688879.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sar68448-allstar-picture-library-sony-794638173.jpg><p>Remarkably, the first person to answer his Whatsapp call was actor Luke Treadaway. who played James in the two A Street Cat Named Bob films.</p><p>Luke, 38, who also portrayed <a href=#>Alex Higgins</a> in the BBC snooker movie The Rack Pack and starred in<a href=#> ­Angelina’s Jolie</a>’s film Unbroken, offered to help.</p><p>He provided the money James needed to stay at a backpackers’ ­hostel then buy a flight home.</p><p>The former Big Issue seller says of Luke: “How incredible he was, to be there for me after all this time.”</p><p>After four days and three nights detoxing in Bangkok, James knows he cannot make the same potentially fatal mistake again.</p><p>Since returning to his home in South London almost three months ago, he has not touched drugs again.</p><p>“It made me realise I screwed everything up and I needed to make it right,” James promises.</p><p>He knows that he needs a purpose in life.</p><p>His plan is to return to supporting organisations such as <a href=#>The Big Issue</a>, which helps homeless people, and the Blue Cross pet charity.</p><p>James, who has released songs in the past, has a home studio where he is making more music — and there is also interest in him making a documentary series about living down and out.</p><p>He also wants to move from the detached £500,000 home “which Bob bought me” because it holds too many memories of the cat.</p><p>To many people, it might sound strange that one person’s hopes and dreams could be so inextricably linked to their pet, but there is little doubt that James had a remarkable connection with Bob.</p><p>The stray started following him everywhere shortly after he moved to a council flat in North ­London in 2007.</p><p>When Bob did not fancy walking, he would perch on James’s shoulder — and he stunned his owner with his level of intelligence.</p><p>James says: “Bob was a genius. He knew where the camera was, we had to put child locks on all the ­cupboards because of him.”</p><p>When they first met, James was on a methadone programme aimed at weaning him off opioids.</p><p>He credits the friendly feline with persuading him to stay off drugs.</p><p>That uplifting tale was turned into the best-selling book A Street Cat Named Bob in 2010, which sold more than a million copies in Britain and reached global best-seller lists.</p><p>James says: “Everywhere we went people queued to see us when we did book signings. Fonz star Henry Winkler queued for three hours to meet us at the Covent Garden Waterstones, I was told.</p><h2>‘Bob’s soul held on until I was there’</h2><p>“I felt that being in the public eye I was able to serve a purpose. Explaining where I came from.”</p><p>The pair visited Japan, Germany, Norway, Holland, Portugal, France and Canada, and met royalty at The Street Cat Named Bob premiere in 2016 attended by Kate, now ­Princess of Wales.</p><p>Bob played himself in the movie, with help from a few furry stand-ins.</p><p>James recalls: “She gave Bob a scratch by the ears. He knew he was in the presence of important people. We had a little chat. She does incredible work.”</p><p>The estimated £1million James earned from book sales meant he was able to buy his own home.</p><p>Finally settled, he met Monika in 2018 and they were planning to get hitched in 2020.</p><p>But Covid lockdown restrictions forced them to postpone the ­ceremony.</p><p>When Bob did not return home one night, the frantic couple went searching everywhere for him.</p><p>They learned that tragically he had been taken to a vet after being run over.</p><p>By the time James arrived, his most precious friend <a href=#>had been declared dead.</a></p><p>But he reveals: “His eyes were still open when I collected him from the vet’s.</p><p>“As I took him home, I believe his soul held on until I was there, then he closed his eyes.”</p><p>No one is certain how old Bob was, because James found him as a stray, but he was probably aged between 14 and 16.</p><p>James filled their home with new animals, including cats Bandit and Gizmo, both aged three, and a dog called Chewbacca, aged two.</p><p>They already had another cat named Jinxy, five, who has been known to do high-fives like Bob.</p><p>But neither the animals nor his wife-to-be were enough to shake the troubled musician out of his overwhelming grief.</p><p>He explains: “I picked up Bandit and Gizmo and they gave me a spring of hope, but once you are in that spiral it is hard to get out.</p><p>“I was failing my relationship. I didn’t want to cause her any grief, so I ended it with her.”</p><p>Like so many people who find sudden fame, it was also tough for James to no longer be involved with high-profile projects.</p><p>He says: “I was proud of what I was doing. When it disappeared, I was in a hole. I have a hole I need to fill.”</p><p>Thankfully, he does have a lot of friends and followers who want him to succeed.</p><p>Learning of his ­problems last year, a group of fans got some money together to help him kick hard drugs.</p><p>But he wants to reassure them it is no longer needed and the cash will be returned.</p><p>James is supported by his dad John in London, but he is still estranged from his mum Penelope, who lives in <a href=#>Australia</a>.</p><p>More than two-and-a-half years after Bob’s death, though, it is clear the pain will never go away.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Even now, James still talks about his pet in the present tense, saying: “I am so proud to be his owner.”</p><p>By pulling himself back from the brink once more, he would have made Bob proud as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2016-writer-james-bowen-bob-589750557.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/41286e77-a4c1-4631-88cc-b7ae704b1a95.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSEdIKSbWhsZ5qWuqa%2FjJumsJ2eYrCiwIybpptllKfCqL%2BMoZyrp5mjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
