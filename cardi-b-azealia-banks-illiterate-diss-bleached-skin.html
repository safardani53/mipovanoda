Maybe Azealia Banks didn’t get the message, but Cardi B, 25, is not the one to stay silent when she thinks she’s being attacked. On May 11 – within hours of her fellow rapper slamming her on The Breakfast Club, the “Bodak Yellow” star clapped back on Instagram."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

On May 11 – within hours of her fellow rapper slamming her on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Breakfast Club</a>, the “Bodak Yellow” star clapped back on Instagram. The whole saga began when <strong>DJ Envy</strong>, asked Azealia, 26, if it’s true that she once called Cardi B an “illiterate untalented rat.” Of course Azealia – who has sparred with everyone from <strong>Iggy Azalea</strong> to <strong>Zayn Malik</strong> – gleefully said she did. She also explained why.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>A brief clip of her longwinded explanation was shared on The Shade Room’s Instagram page. Azealia said, “I feel like maybe two years ago the conversation surrounding black women’s culture was really reaching an all time high. We were really discussing our power amongst ourselves and <strong>Beyonce</strong> came out with ‘Lemonade’ and there was just this really…intelligent conversation going on nationally. And then everything just kind of changed. And then it was like, Cardi B.” Wow. Don’t hold back, Miss Banks.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Azealia went even further, calling Cardi B a “caricature of a black woman” and slamming her “spelling and grammar.” Naturally this all didn’t sit well with Cardi B who defended herself and delivered a few home truths along the way. She wrote, “Beyonce? Wasn’t Beyonce the same woman she was talking s*** about and dragging all over the media?” (Yes, Cardi. The very same Beyonce. For the record, in 2016 Azealia slammed Bey and “Lemonade” in a series of tweets. “She’s not an artist, she’s a poacher,” ” the rapper wrote at one point, according to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Billboard</a>. “She takes food out of darker skinned women’s mouths & pretends to be inspired.”)</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/BirqVwqhqNY/?hl=en&taken-by=iamcardib</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Cardi B then added that she is from the “hood,” writing, “I speak how I speak.” The mom-to-be pointed out that she didn’t “choose to be famous”, but that people followed her on Instagram and made her so. “I never asked to be a [sic] example or a role model,” she added. But she ended by hitting Azealia where it hurts, writing, “This is coming from a woman that bleached her skin but want to advocate. GOODBYE. I’m not apologizing or killing myself because of who I am.” Your move, Azealia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH12e5BqZpyZopm2bq6MmrGemZyerm6uwKeirGWZobmqwMSrmK2dXZm2tL%2BMm6OemZOdsqV50qSgp2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
