Sheryl Lee Ralph has received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Barbara Howard on ABC’s Abbott Elementary — but that wasn’t always the role she wanted to play. 
“When I first read the script, I wanted to play [the principal], Ava,” Ralph, 66, exclusively revealed to Us Weekly at the 2023 PaleyFest red carpet on Saturday, April 1. “And [series creator] Quinta [Brunson] was just, like, ‘Absolutely not! We need a queen for Barbara and that is you."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We need a queen for Barbara and that is you.’ So I was like, ‘Well, alrighty then. Thank you.’”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Ralph eventually realized that Barbara was a perfect fit — while Ava Coleman belonged to<strong> Janelle James</strong> — and the Connecticut native went on to win her first&nbsp;Primetime Emmy in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series category in September 2022. Four months later, she took home the Critics’ Choice Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Sheryl-Lee-Ralph-Wanted-to-Play-Ava-on-Abbott-Elementary-But-Quinta-Brunson-Needed-a-Queen-for-Barbara-655.jpg><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Now, the Moesha alum — <a href=#>who has spent more than 40 years working</a> in Hollywood — is shining in the role, and gushed to Us about everything that makes her character such an essential part of the Abbott Elementary family.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I think it’s really the fact that Barbara is committed to human beings. Her love of her job, the love of the students that are entrusted in her care, every year,” she explained, joking that the<b>&nbsp;</b>elementary school&nbsp;teacher is “the kind of person that would agree to disagree, but trust me, in the end you’re going to agree with her.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>She added: “I just love that about her. She’s a wonderful human being.”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The most seasoned and longest-working teacher at Abbott, Barbara is revered by the other teachers as a mentor and inspiration. Ralph, for her part, <a href=#>portrays the character as someone who commands respect</a> — and puts the education of her students before anything else.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I love the way — even though it’s difficult — she looks out for the younger ones,” Ralph told Us on Saturday. “That’s so important. I cannot tell people enough, you have got to pay more attention to young people. How in the world are they going to learn?”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The Sister Act 2 actress isn’t the only one who has skyrocketed to stardom following Abbott Elementary’s success.

Something is happening</a>,’” she recalled to Us last month. “Going into the first season — the first 18 episodes — we were not shocked at all. We knew we were doing something very special.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJWnxq15y56cZqqRob2peZCsq2avkaPBprCMraZmqJyWxm6t1ZpkqKZdlq%2Bju9OtZJ6klaKyr8DAq7Bo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
