Now in its second season, Marrying Millions has introduced a new inter-wealthy couple: Erica Moser, 23, and Rick Sykes, 69, whose biggest problem — on screen, anyway — is their over-40 year age difference."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"We just connected through Instagram," she recalled in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FOX</a>. "Neither one of us really knows how."</p><p>She goes on to say that the two were "just kind of following each other for a year or so and just seeing each other's photos and liking whatever, and we never really talked."&nbsp;</p><p>"But then," she continues, "he just randomly sent me a couple of messages and we started talking and then we met. And then the rest is history."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On her YouTube channel, the 23-year-old explains that she's been into "age gap relationships" for a while now and finds them "less dramatic and non-problematic" than dating people her own age. At one point, she even mentions dating an ex whose three grown children were older than Erica at the time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Anyway, after Rick and Erica connected, he urged her to "come live with me on my yacht," which the gorgeous blonde initially thought that was a "crazy thing to send somebody that you don't even know." Eventually, she caved and moved out to Miami Beach to live on Rick's yacht.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Rick and Erica still together today?</h2><p>The biggest problem we see Rick and Erica face on Marrying Millions revolves around the star's dad who, let's just say, isn't particularly obsessed with the fact that his daughter goes out with someone older than him.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I can't blame my dad for not being happy or being completely supportive," Erica says, understandingly. "It was definitely not his dream for his little baby girl to be dating someone older than him."</p><p>To date, her father has not really become "OK" or "comfortable" with the fact that the couple remain an item, but Erica says she "really [doesn't] blame him."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"My dad is very nervous and he's very worried about how it's going to affect his daily life," she said about her dad's anxiety about having agreed to be on the show. "I feel sorry that I kind of dragged him into this, but I'm very grateful that he stuck it through with me."</p><p>However, the father and daughter are "not really" on great terms these days.</p><p>Things for Erica are much better when it comes to her other old man, as she and Rick are still going strong and update fans on their newfound Marrying Millions fame. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erica</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick</a> are both on Instagram, and Erica also maintains a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> channel.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>When one fan wrote she was "noticing no pics of Rick on her Instagram," Erica clapped back to say that "he's literally in every YouTube video, 3/4 of my TikToks, and on a show lol. Everyone knows we are together. It's honestly just nice having ONE platform that isn't full of hate comments."</p><p>Fair enough!
