For starters, she’s selling their stuff without their permission. But they already learned that last week. What they discovered this week was how much June’s appearance has changed since they last saw her. In a video posted online, <strong>Pumpkin</strong> and <strong>Honey Boo Boo</strong> saw their mom goofing around with boyfriend <strong>Geno</strong> <strong>Doak</strong>, while talking about selling their bed. June’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>missing tooth</a> was also hard to miss, and Pumpkin said she was “looking rough”. It was also “terrifying” for her to see that her own mom couldn’t even form a full sentence while speaking. It was so disturbing that Honey Boo Boo got up and left the room immediately after watching it.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Later in the episode, <strong>Sugar Bear</strong>‘s wife <strong>Jennifer</strong> also saw the video and she said Mama June looked “awful”. <strong>Doe Doe</strong> also agreed, and she wondered if this might just be Mama June’s “rock bottom”. Because if it wasn’t, she couldn’t imagine what it might end up being. After all, selling all of one’s possessions seems like a pretty low place to be.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mama has to finally face what she's been running from TOMORROW on an all-new episode of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#MamaJune</a> at 9/8c! <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/i5F5OFKooe</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>— Mama June (@MamaJune_WEtv) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 7, 2020</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Fortunately, Doe Doe learned that Mama June had a court appearance coming up, so she decided to head over to the court so she could see June and try to talk some sense into her. Doe Doe found out that if Mama June missed the court appearance, she’d have a warrant for her arrest, so she couldn’t imagine why Mama June would skip out on it. But even so, no one was interested in going with Doe Doe to the court house. So she went alone with the producers, and when the clock struck nine, Mama June still hadn’t shown up. Or did she? In the few final seconds of this week’s episode, it appeared as though she pulled up just in the nick of time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In other news from this week, Honey Boo Boo had a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sleepover</a> to get her mind off of the drama, and Sugar Bear went to get a procedure to help him have better erections. Yes, really.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Want more drama?
