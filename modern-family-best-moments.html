The show kicked off in 2009 and has brought us some hilarious moments that we will never forget.
What are the best moments from Modern Family? We just love the Pritchards, the Dunpheys and the Tuckers.
But in life, all good things must come to an end, and unfortunately that means Modern Family.
However, let us take you on a little trip down memory lane with all the best moments from the show."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

and us - to descend into giggles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-07-at-13.36.16-e1586334893607.png><h3>Robot Phil</h3><p>Oh how we loved Robot Phil.</p><p>After having to miss a family party due to work commitments out of town, always the tech-geek, Phil decides to attach an iPad to a remote controlled scooter, so he doesn't miss out.</p><p>Just watching him milling about Jay's house as this floating head was enough to have us all in stitches.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000575818175-e1586334998700.jpg><h3>Cam and Gloria looking for Stella</h3><p>Gloria's relationship with Jay's beloved dog Stella makes us laugh at the best of times, but when she accidentally leaves the door open and Stella gets out, she enlists the help of Cam.</p><p>The pair are seen hilariously screaming "Stella" down the street, with Cam in full dramatic mode.</p><p>They are so loud, that a few street's away Jay says: "What the hell's that noise?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000575814898-e1586335375831.jpg><h3>Mitch and Cam introduce Lily</h3><p>In the pilot episode we see Mitch and Cam adopting Lily from Vietnam and bringing her home.</p><p>They then organise a party to reveal Lily to the family, who had no idea they were getting a baby.</p><p>When Mitch reveals that him and Cam (who is out of the room at this point) had some big news, Jay wants to know why Cam is always so "dramatic", to which Mitch says, "My boyfriend is not dramatic!"</p><p>Just as he says this the Lion King theme song starts playing with Cam holding baby Lily up in the air like in the movie - classic Cam.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-07-at-13.40.03.png><h3>Jay and Cam touch butts</h3><p>After a game of racket ball Jay and Cam are in the locker room getting changed.</p><p>They unfortunately both bend over to pull up their shorts at the same time and their naked butts touch, much to Jay's shock.</p><p>However, unfazed Cam just says: "This can't be your first moon landing?"</p><p>Jay: "You got a name for it?"</p><p>Cam: "It's very common."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000575818166-e1586334623852.jpg><h3>Drugged up Mitch and Cam</h3><p>Mitch and Cam take a sleeping pill but then their flight gets delayed.</p><p>They are heading off to Missouri and take a tranquillizer to help them sleep on the flight.</p><p>However, the flight gets delayed and they get pulled off the flight with hilarious consequences, including them talking to a hat stand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000575817079-e1586334730359.jpg><h3>Smoke alarm</h3><p>One of the most hilarious episodes in season two, called Chirp, is when poor Phil is being driven mad by the incessant bleeping from a smoke alarm - but he can't work out where it is.</p><p>He desperately wants to prove he is the man of the house but every time it bleeps he screams, "oh no!" in frustration.</p><p>We later find out that Luke had put all of the old smoke alarms in the attic, instead of throwing them away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000575818173-e1586334787886.jpg><h3>Gloria's karaoke</h3><p>When Gloria is pregnant in season 4 she decides to sing to the baby through a mobile karaoke set - much to Jay and Manny's dismay.</p><p>As we know Gloria hasn't got the best singing voice.</p><p>But watching her belt out a tune while Jay and Manny wince is hilarious.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000574216528-e1586335440769.jpg><h3>Jay slaps the chicken</h3><p>Gloria is fed up with Jay mocking her "traditional Columbian ways" passed onto her by her late grandmother.</p><p>So, she manages to trick Jay into "slapping the chicken" that she is preparing, as it is a "Columbian tradition" -
