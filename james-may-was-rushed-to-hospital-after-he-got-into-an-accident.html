Now Salman Rushdie and James May are in hospital</p><p>— Faisal Amjad (@FaisalAmjad1) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 12, 2022</a></p><h2>Why was James May admitted to the hospital?</h2><p>May’s vehicle slammed against a wall while shooting a drag race with Jeremy Clarkson for The Grand Tour, breaking a rib. May and Clarkson had to drive their rally cars down a tunnel towards a rock wall at a Norwegian naval station for the challenge.&nbsp;The tunnel light, on the other hand, only switched on as the vehicles accelerated, allowing drivers fewer than five seconds to respond if they didn’t have enough room. May seemed to have discovered this too late, as he slammed on the brakes before crashing into the wall.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/James-May-2.jpg alt="James May" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Paramedics hurried to the scene and assisted May in getting to the hospital, and the program proceeded to record without him.</p><p>According to a person who spoke to The Sun,</p><p>“At first, it seemed really concerning. Jeremy and Richard were worried about their friend, so paramedics arrived shortly. As with any large-scale production, medical personnel is on standby in case things go tragically wrong, as they did here.”</p><p>According to the source, James struck his head hard and is presently in discomfort in his back and neck.&nbsp;The Grand Tour was created by May and Clarkson, as well as Richard Hammond, James May, and Andy Wilman.
