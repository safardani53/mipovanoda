“On the first day of filming, Bob literally wrote notes to everyone and put them in their trailers,” Laura told HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Happy first day of filming.’ So I feel that in itself just completely broke the ice for someone like me who was so starstruck. I think the whole shoot kind of continued in that way. Bob is someone who definitely, even though it’s a family comedy, still takes the work seriously, but he doesn’t take himself seriously. It was a really cool experience to act alongside that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/laura-marano-the-war-with-grandpa-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>As Peter and Ed go at it with elaborate pranks, Laura’s character Mia is going head-to-head with her mom Sally, played by Thurman, over a boy. “Mia is your sassy teenage daughter. She is a little self-involved. She is so focused on trying to date this guy that she doesn’t notice there is a war going on between her grandfather and her brother,” Laura continued. “But what I will say is that overall there’s this really nice dynamic that comes out between Bob and Uma of, as a parent, you go through things when you’re a kid, and then when your kid is going through them, all of a sudden you have a bit of a different lens and different perspective and forget how it was when you were a kid. So Uma has that kind of moment with my character about this idea that she just needs to not lose time with her daughter and accept whoever she wants to date.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/laura-marano-the-war-with-grandpa-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Tensions can and often do run high between mothers and daughters during those dramatic teenage years. Laura loved being able to explore that dynamic with Uma. “It was crazy,” Laura admitted. “To be honest, we had a few scenes where we had to scream at each other. I was so intimidated. I’m like, how am I going to do this with the Uma Thurman, and it ended up being such a fun scene and such an easy scene. Overall, I feel I just had this incredible experience with not just Uma but the whole cast. It was amazing.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In addition to her latest movie, which will be released Oct. 9, Laura also has released a brand-new EP titled YOU. She revealed the inspiration behind this <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>latest collection of songs</a>. “When I was working on my first EP ever, which I released last year, the Me EP, there was still more of the story I wanted to tell. Even more than that, I wanted to tell this other perspective. So that’s where I kind of came up with this idea of YOU. Once I had that idea in my head and that vision, everything slowly but surely fell into place. I was looking at music I’d written a while ago and kind of reworking a little bit to fit this new era of my music. I finished a bunch of the songs up while in quarantine, which was a very strange experience, but I think really is part of the framework of the sonics of the song, which is kind of cool. I’m excited to listen back a year from now and remember how I made certain songs, or did vocals, or did this, while we were stuck at our homes.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe49wZqWZpaeubrnAq5inp12nvKOx0a1knZ1do7azu4ynpq2dXayus3nWoquhZZenrq%2Bwz5pm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
