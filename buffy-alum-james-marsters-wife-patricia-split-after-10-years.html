They tied the knot in a private civil ceremony in Los Angeles in January 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/James-Marsters-and-Wife-Patricia-Jasmin-Rahman-Split-After-10-Years-of-Marriage.jpg><p>Marsters was previously married to <strong>Liane Davidson</strong>, from whom he split in 1997 after eight years together. The exes share 24-year-old son Sullivan.</p><p>The California native is best known for his role as vampire Spike on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which ran for seven seasons between 1997 and 2003. He <a href=#>reprised the character</a> in the show’s spinoff, Angel, which aired for five seasons between 1999 and 2004. Since then, Marsters has appeared on Smallville, Hawaii Five-0 and Witches of East End. He has also recorded music both as a solo artist and a member of rock band Ghost of the Robot.</p><p>While he’s maintained a steady career in the years since <strong>Joss Whedon</strong>‘s beloved supernatural series came to an end, Marsters will always have a soft spot for the vampire character — as will Buffy fans. During a March 2017 interview with <a href=#>The A.V. Club</a>, Marsters admitted that the amount of time he spends getting recognized for playing Spike “depends on the week.”</p><p>“If I get on an airplane: 20 hours a week, I’m being recognized,” he joked. “If I’m staying home, just with my friends, maybe 15 minutes. It depends on if I go out or not. In my normal life, I surround myself with people who don’t think about Buffy very much. And so I can have a normal life. If I’m going out, the world wants to talk about it. And I think that’s a good thing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/James-Marsters-Sarah-Michelle-Gellar-Buffy.jpg><p>Buffy also starred <a href=#><strong>Sarah Michelle Gellar</strong></a>, who played the titular role, <a href=#><strong>Alyson Hannigan</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>David Boreanaz</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Nicholas Brendon</strong></a> and more. The show was praised for its strong female characters and for <a href=#>showcasing an LGBTQ romance</a> — but the cast isn’t so sure a reboot will do the original series justice.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There’s a time and a place for everything and when something is done really, really well, you don’t have to reboot it, because it still holds up,” Gellar, 43, told <a href=#>Parade</a> magazine in October 2019. “And so I think that’s what I struggle with a little bit. People discover Buffy today and love it just the same as if they discovered it 20 years ago. There are movies I watch, like Sixteen Candles, I love it just as much today as I did then. Why would I want to see it redone? So, I am probably in the minority on that.”</p><p>However, the Cruel Intentions star also saw a silver lining to the idea of bringing those fan-favorite characters back to life. “That being said, go reboot it if you have a new way to tell the story with new people, and bring other people that maybe haven’t seen it,” she added. “In the end, I believe it will only bring more viewers to the original. And how much better the original is.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabrZabxm6ty66kZqKRorK0ecyaqayslafAbsPIn5xmqJGpv6qvyJpkrKicnsFurcWtnKtlYWV6urHAq6po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
