There were several hiccups along the way — including many emotional <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stare-at-the-wall-breaks</a> and the cringiest fantasy suite conversation of all time. But the biggest drama of all? One word: Jed.</p><p>The big engagement took place in Greece, after saying a tear-filled goodbye to Tyler before he had the chance to propose. Jed’s proposal, on the other hand, started with a musical number and ended with him proclaiming his love on one knee. Hannah graciously accepted the ring, but in their time together afterwards, she learned via a magazine article that her fiancé was in a serious relationship when he left to film for the Bachelorette.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Clearly, Hannah’s journey to find love isn’t over just yet, especially since she admitted on the live season finale—<i>to</i> Tyler himself — that she still has feelings for the runner-up. In fact, she even asked him on a drink date!</p><p>We can only hope that the Alabama-born beauty queen finds another suitor (*cough Tyler *cough) that makes her heart sing and hopefully we get to see another Neil Lane on her finger.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5eupLTEpaarnaSpsm60wKelmqBdl3qmusaanp6llaPBbr7Ip55mnJWprqq40mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
