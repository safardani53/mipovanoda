The rapper, 45, has recently returned to mocking the comedian, as well as others, on Instagram.
Pete and Kim split in August and ever since, her ex-husband Kanye has resurfaced on Instagram to go off on him again.
Though he’s shared a slew of strange comments and memes on social media lately, Kanye claimed a recent one attributed to him was not actually his doing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Like way more than a normal person should have it.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Kanye West">Read More on Kanye West</h2><p>In the caption, Kanye insisted: “This was not from me. Someone copied my style of text and wrote something not funny.&nbsp;</p><p>“I know you guys gonna be disappointed but I actually didn’t write the teeet that said ‘Friends wasn’t funny either’ but I wish I had I’d love to know who thought of that I like to post comments Cause y’all n****s is hilarious.”</p><p>The rapper then went on to slam Pete, saying the SNL alum lacks comedic talent.</p><p>Ye wrote: “I love funny people and I think that’s one of the reasons me and Skete could’ve never been friends.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>He went on: “Comedically some of my favorites are Me Mitch Hedberg Anthony Jeselnik Louis CK Jerrod Carmichael Deray JP Smooth Mase Elon Musk 50 Justin LaBoy GLC Eddie Murphy Sakiya Sandifer Chris Rock Larry David Kevin Hart (In Jumanji) and of course King David Dave Chapelle.&nbsp;</p><p>“I like to fight with jokes. Sometimes we gotta laugh to keep from crying even when we dealing with serious topics.&nbsp;</p><p>“S**t be the funniest when it’s true. That n***a that commented on my outfit really does work at universal. Daniel Cherry Pop really wore that hat.”</p><p>On Saturday, Kanye <a href=#>posted a slew of cruel memes</a>, starting with screenshots of multiple members of the Adidas/Gap board, whom he's been feuding with.</p><p>He then mocked up an image of the new Gap SVP - Daniel Cherry - Kid Cudi, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Pete</a>, 28, tacked on the side with his tongue out in infant clothes.</p><p>"Nah, come on guys, I love it," he captioned the crude post.</p><p>Before sharing the jarring post, Kanye posted the same image without Pete.</p><p>He captioned that Saturday snap: "Hi guys I’m back.</p><p>"Sorry to take so long to post. Just had a good meeting with Kim about the schools.</p><p>"But on another note I’m sure this pic gonna send Adidas stock through the ceiling. You're welcome Jing Ulrich, who is on the board at Adidas and JP Morgan."</p><p>"So it makes sense now that when I wanted to sale JP Morgan went silent," he added.</p><p>In a third stand-out Instagram post on Saturday, the hitmaker spoke wildly about Pete at length.</p><p>Kanye seemingly imitated, writing: "'Leave him alone. Hi North, I’m Skete. Look at my tattoos. I’m a pawn sent here to antagonize your dad in hopes that he’ll do something illegal so we can take him out of your life.'</p><p>"Oh Saint, look at my tattoo- I tatted your name on my body."</p><p>Pete got at least four tattoos for Kim when they dated, one was a&nbsp;<a href=#>neck tattoo</a>&nbsp;of all of her four children with Kanye's initials.</p><p>Despite his break-up with Kim and the return of Ye's mockery toward him, fans think <a href=#>Pete is much happier now</a>.</p><p>The comedian resurfaced in a rare photo over the weekend, posing with five smiling ladies in New York City.</p><p>It's unclear if they happened to run into the actor or are friends with him - but what was clear is how fans felt about his energy.</p><p>Fans brought the image over to Reddit in a thread titled: "Pete recently in NY happily out of Kim and Kanye's drama."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Another replied: "I just know for sure he dumped Kim and that makes me happy."</p><p>"Good for him.
