According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a>, they both claimed that they were racially profiled by police on two different occasions between 2020 and 2021. Together, Eric and Clinton filed a lawsuit against the Clayton County police department and the district attorney‘s office.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>They’re arguing to say that it’s completely unconstitutional for airport officers to force passengers to stop between the bridge of their gate to the airplane in order to do random luggage searches.</p><p>Eric says officers questioned him about whether or not he had illegal drugs with him while he was traveling. He told them he didn’t have any drugs, but the officers didn’t stop bothering him anyway. Eric explained that he was the only Black person in sight on that particular bridge.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The Clayton County Police Department posted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a response on their official Facebook page</a> describing the incident in great detail.</p><p>They wrote, “During the encounter, Mr. André voluntarily provided the investigators' information as to his travel plans. Mr. André also voluntarily consented to a search of his luggage but the investigators chose not to do so. Investigators identified that there was no reason to continue a conversation and therefore terminated the encounter.”</p><p>They ended the post by saying, “Mr. André boarded the plane without being detained and continued on his travels. The Drug Enforcement Administration and the Atlanta Police Department did not assist in this consensual encounter.”</p><p>Someone responded in the comment section calling the Clayton County police department out for “BS" by stating that there was “nothing consensual" about what they did to Eric. Other people in the comment section are telling the police department to release body cam footage, airport recordings, and visual proof of what exactly took place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmr%2Bqr4yapZ2qlWK7psCMsKarrJg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
