Of course ITV don't just show Ascot, either, as we will also cover the fixture at York. Seven races in total.
Let's get straight to it, and the 1.50pm at Ascot is the Group 3 Princess Margaret over 6f for juveniles.
ANGEL'S HIDEAWAY didn't do Frankie Dettori any favours getting him a ban at Newmarket last time, but she brings in sold form after that second in the Duchess of Cambridge and fourth in the Albany at Royal Ascot."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Every chance for John Gosden.</p><p>Next up at Ascot is a 1m handicap at 2.25pm. <strong>CRACK ON CRACK ON</strong> never got in the Britannia at Royal Ascot after being hampered just after the start.</p><p>However, he was previously in good form for Clive Cox and will be hard to keep out the frame.</p><h3><a href=# rel>GLORIOUS GOODWOOD LIVE<span> All the latest news, tips, odds and weather updates from the track</span></a></h3><p>There's an impossible looking 7f heritage handicap to sort out at 3.00pm. I think it will be hard for <strong>RIPP ORF</strong> not to get involved.</p><p>He loves these big field handicaps for David Elsworth and is at reasonable odds. His Victoria Cup win was something special.</p><p>And then it's the big one, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at 3.40pm. I've discussed this race at length in my Sun column, but I have to stay with<strong> CRYSTAL OCEAN</strong> for Sir Michael Stoute. He's improving, stays and an easy horse to ride.</p><p>The York coverage starts at 2.05pm with a handicap over 7f. <strong>GET KNOTTED</strong> is totally in the grip of the handicapper for Michael Dods, but he's consistent and this trip is ideal. Strong place claims.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Latest in Horse Racing</h2></p><p>Then at York there is a handicap over 6f at 2.40pm. <strong>GOLDEN APOLLO</strong> hasn't quite managed to get his head in front so far this season but has been running okay and could hit the frame for Tim Easterby. He's got lots of handicap form which gives him every chance.</p><p>And finally ITV show the 3.15pm, a Group 2 over an extended 1m2f. I have to stick with <strong>ELARQAM</strong> here in that I expect he's much better than we have seen this season.</p><p>Of course his fourth in the 2000 Guineas was a fine effort but he was terrible for Mark Johnston in the Irish equivalent. Hopefully this step up in trip is ideal.</p><p>So best of luck and hope for Yeeehaaas. You Betcha!</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Charlie Fellowes has his sights set on Cup glory with Prince Of Arran</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cIKXcWdsbGZktrXCjKuYnKGenHq1tc%2BsZJqrk6TBbsXOq6Jo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
