I’ve hung out with his brother, he’s awesome. His mom, you know, he’s got a little Spanish flair. I think that Peter and his family are just great.”</p><p>Despite the Texas native’s love for Weber, he still regards him as the “safe” casting selection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mike-Johnson-Peter-Weber-Safe-Pick-for-Bachelor-01.jpg><p>While Johnson suspects his chances of being named the Bachelor are slim, a source exclusively revealed to Us Weekly that he is definitely in the running for the coveted spot. “Mike is being seriously considered to be Bachelor, and producers have brought up his name a lot to potential contestants,” the insider shared with Us.</p><p>The Air Force vet <a href=#>spoke with Us at July’s “Men Tell All” special</a> about his thoughts on becoming the franchise’s first black Bachelor. He said the possibility made him “feel awesome.”</p><p>“It puts a smile on my face to know that people want me to find the love that I want so dearly,” Johnson told Us at the taping. “I’m, like, super humble in the sense of I shy it down quite often, but being completely transparent, it makes me feel amazing that people would even consider that for me.”</p><p>Johnson, Weber and <a href=#><strong>Tyler Cameron</strong></a> had been rumored as potential candidates from Brown’s season of The Bachelorette to succeed <a href=#><strong>Colton Underwood</strong></a> as Bachelor. However, host <a href=#><strong>Chris Harrison</strong></a> noted that <a href=#>Cameron’s odds were slim</a> after he was spotted on a string of dates with supermodel <a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a>.

That’s fine,” Harrison, 48, told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> earlier this month. “If that’s what you want to do right now, I don’t blame him. He’s probably enjoying life really, really well.”</p><p>Harrison noted that Cameron’s post-Bachelorette journey made him “not someone we’re going to want to have as our Bachelor,” adding, “It’s about sincerity. It’s about where you are in your life. And if that’s where he is in his life, then he’s not the guy for us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSio5Vit7C0zaymp2WgmsGmvoywnJudoqh6tbTEZqqanpVivaqvymadqKpdqbWmecGamqGdnKS%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
