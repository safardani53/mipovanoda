There he became the winner of a national JUCO championship.</p><p>Later the fighter joined Morrisville State College to pursue a degree in criminal justice.</p><p>But, unfortunately, he could not complete the course because his true love was a mixed martial art, and he wanted to focus on making a career out of it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Age, Height & Weight</h2><p>Jon celebrates his birthday on July 19 of every year.

He was a replacement fighter but took advantage of the opportunity to showcase his skills.</p><p>In the next UFC fight, he faced Stephen Bonnar, a well-experienced veteran, on January 31, 2009. Unfortunately, the match was not even close between both fighters as Jones was still an underdog going in.&nbsp;</p><p>But ‘Bones’ proved that night he could also face a veteran fighter with his extraordinary spinning back elbow and suplex. As a result, Jon won the match with a unanimous decision.</p><p>In 2012, he fought against Brandon Vera and Vladimir Matyushenko and won both after getting his first title against the three-champion Mauricio “Shogun” Rua.</p><p>According to Jon Jones, the most challenging match he ever played was against Swedish Fighter Alexander Gustafson at UFC 165 on September 23, 2013.

He even had to step down from the Light Heavyweight title and could have been banned for four years.</p><p>On May 19, 2012, Jon got involved in a minor accident when he crashed his car into a pole in Binghamton, New York, after a night of partying.</p><p>Jones was taken into custody after refusing to take a sobriety test. He was told to give a $1,000 fine two months later, and his driver’s license was suspended for six months.</p><p>Likewise, in 2014, Jon was involved in another major controversy. The Nevada State Athletic Commission(NCAC) charged him $50,000 for brawling with <a href=#>Daniel Cormier</a> at a UFC 178 press event.</p><p>Also, he was handed 40 hours of community service work.</p><p>In early 2015, Jones became a primary suspect in a hit-and-run-incident after New Mexico police allegations. Thus, he could not match Anthony Johnson that year.</p><p>The incident led him to be sentenced to 18 months and subsequently stripped off his belt by the UFC.

With this, Jones inked his name in the history books as the youngest UFC champion ever and has yet to be broken.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Youngest-UFC-champion-Jones.jpg><p>Jon sents spinning kicks, elbows, and everything one could imagine at the champion in the fight. He finished off Mauricio on the ground with what could only be described as an excessive justified force.</p><p>Moreover, Jones has secured wins over an impressive list of highly accomplished MMA competitors, including Quinton Jackson, Lyoto Machindo, Vitor Belfort, <a href=# rel=noopener>Chael Sonnen</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Alexander Gustafsson</a>.</p><h3>Fighting Style of Jon Jones</h3><p>Bones is one of the best at controlling distance.

He also cleared that it was Hamill’s shoulder injury, due to which he couldn’t continue the fight, not because of Jone’s elbow.</p><p>In his fight against Jon, Hamill suffered a dislocated shoulder. Unfortunately, referee Steve didn’t see it coming, and this loss remains on Jones’ record that can never be erased.</p><p>The loss is controversial on Jone’s record since he has never lost a single fight.</p><h2>Jon Jones: Wife & Children</h2><p>Jon married <a href=#><strong>Jessie Moses</strong></a> in 2013.
