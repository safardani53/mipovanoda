"Within 72 hours, Jon and I packed our things, found friends to care for Oscar and Loulou, gave copies of our keys to our neighbor, canceled work and cleared our schedules, and were on our way to the hospital in New York City."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She later <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>shared a picture</a> of herself and Batiste lying in a hospital bed on Instagram. She captioned the selfie, "First 72 hours in the bone marrow transplant unit: co-sleeping in a tiny hospital bed, painting, prank calling (including—by request—a nurse's boyfriend), blood draws and bags of chemo, hospital room choreographies and hallway laps (14 = a mile), and never not rubbing my newly bald head."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After a quiet few months on social media, Jaouad gave followers <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>an update</a> about her medical journey, writing, "I've been on a long break from anything internet related for the last month. I've resumed chemo, and I've been resting, reading novels, hanging out with my new road dog River (more on her soon!), and spending time with family."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She included a sweet photo of herself kissing her new dog and finished the post with, "P.S.

At the time, family members weren't allowed to visit patients, so Batiste turned to music to stay connected to his wife. The lullabies he wrote her have since inspired the song "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Butterfly</a>," which appears on his album World Music Radio.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s just such a personal narrative song in relation to my life and what my family has gone through and my wife and all of the things she’s been able to overcome,” Batiste told PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2023, Batiste appeared on Sherri and gave the TV host an update on his wife's health.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>It's a miracle</a>.

"This is not, you know, a hasty decision!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Batiste provided more information about their wedding at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>TIME 100 Gala</a> on June 8, 2022, where he was honored as one of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>TIME magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told PEOPLE</a> that they decided to get married in their own home because "it has been a place we go to replenish our soul."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We built something very, very special.

And it's amazing that we have that in the midst of this time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He also praised Jaouad's strength, saying, "You wouldn't think that she is going through what she's going through when you see her.
