All three bikini-clad girls faced their butts to the camera, with Kendall sitting in the middle so her rear was what your eyes went to first. We have to say, we don’t really understand why Kendall feels like her butt gets overlooked — we think she has an amazing one!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>,&nbsp;what do you think of Kendall’s comment about her ‘a**’?
