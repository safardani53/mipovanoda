Mariah — who goes by the name “Mimi” to her nearest and dearest — stayed warm in a white furry jacket with a smart hood as she braced the cool east coast temperatures. Never to be seen in flats, Mariah sported a pair of black boots with a sky high heel as she snapped selfies and signed a few autographs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/mariah-carey-slit-gown-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Mariah <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced her series of Christmas shows</a> — dubbed Mariah Carey: Merry Christmas To All! — back in November as part of a broadcast special with CBS and streaming platform Paramount+. The show kicked off in Toronto, Canada on Dec. 9 followed by a second show at Ontario’s Scotiabank Arena on Dec. 11 where she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>had an assist on-stage</a> from adorable daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Monroe Cannon</strong></a>, 11. She then returned home to the Big Apple for two sold-out shows on Dec. 13 and Dec. 16.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The Grammy winning superstar is easily one of the most associated celebrities with Christmas due to her timeless album Merry Christmas which was released in 1994. The project includes her chart topping hit “All I Want For Christmas Is You,” which she co-wrote with <strong>Walter Afanasieff</strong>. The song went on to become one of the best selling singles of all time, which has spawned different versions and remakes by other artists. In 2011, Mariah also collaborated with<strong> Justin Bieber</strong> for the “SuperFestive” edition.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I know it’s like ‘ha ha she loves Christmas,’ no I literally do,” she said to<strong> Naomi Campbell</strong> on her YouTube series No Filter with Naomi back in 2020. “I know people are like ‘you love Christmas!’ and they make fun of me, but it’s okay because I do. I actually do. It’s what I love,” she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5BwZqaZop6uqXnCmqmesV2starAxGaeqK%2BeYrCpvsisq6aZo2LAqbvWZqWym12ltbDAzqxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
