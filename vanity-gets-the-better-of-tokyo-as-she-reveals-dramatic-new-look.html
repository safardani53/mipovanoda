Back in 2020, Tokyo had reportedly lost around 50 pounds in total, and now it‚Äôs looking like way more.</p><p>Tokyo has even revealed that, since she dropped her weight loss pictures to social media, she‚Äôs had several men in her DMs asking to take her for a walk. She <a href=#>wrote</a>:</p><p>Y‚Äôall I done uploaded my weight loss pics now all the men in my DMs asking me on walking dates, that‚Äôs so cute.</p><p>The rapper is continuing to shed the pounds on her weight loss journey, and we can‚Äôt wait to see it!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by VANITY MAFIA (@tokyo__vanity)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-did-the-lahh-star-lose-weight>How did the LAHH star lose weight?</h2><p>Tokyo enlisted the help of personal trainer Body by Ted, when he tasked her with lifting, squatting and running under a program on his website <a href=#>BigGirlzMove.com</a>. One of her recent work-outs involved an arm weights exercise.</p><p>Just a day ago (February 7th), she shared a <a href=#>video</a> alongside her trainer and jokily said that the move is what she does ‚Äúbefore I have a show or go to the club in case I have to fight one of y‚Äôall‚Äù.</p><p>She has also been eating healthier foods alongside her regular exercise regime. This has sometimes included hitting up the gym more than once a day and trying to stay motivated.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lol I don‚Äôt think she will do all that.

She knows all too well that dropping pounds doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean she will feel happier, but she seems to have a newfound confidence.</p><p>When a troll pointed this out, she <a href=#>responded</a> by referring to the transformation pic [above] featured on IG:</p><p>I was actually happier on the left than I am on the right so I really don‚Äôt get your point.</p><p>Her fans had her back during the ordeal. One praised her always loving herself no matter what size she is.</p><p>They <a href=#>wrote</a>: ‚ÄúCrazy part about true self love is that you love and embrace yourself at every stage and transition, you appreciate yourself at every phase. And you‚Äôve always shown that.. people be weird and projecting.‚Äù</p><p>Another agreed with Tokyo and <a href=#>said</a>: ‚ÄúYea, being small doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre automatically happier.
