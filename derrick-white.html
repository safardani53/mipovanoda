He has an older sister named Brianna White in the family.</p><p>Born and brought up in Parker, Colorado, Derrick initially attended the local school there. He belonged to a family with low economic background, and both his parents worked hard for a living.</p><p>White was very gentle and playful since he was a kid. As both his parents used to engage in sports during their youth, he too soon got engrossed in extra-curricular activities.</p><p>His father, Richard, played basketball during his high school days. He was an avid fan of the Boston Celtics and used to think of getting into the NBA. However, his dream never came true.</p><p>Little did father Richard know that his son would be one of the famous NBA players appearing for his favorite club, the Celtics, in the future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Derrick-with-his-parents-1024x1024.jpg><p>Derrick showed that he was dedicated to basketball before he joined high school. A former university coach named Marcus Mason had just started a basketball program called Nothing But Net in Colorado during the same time.</p><p>White regularly showed up there and began practicing shooting and dribbling while Mason used to organize camps.</p><p>Even though Derrick was short, he showed promise. Similarly, his parents let him give more time to it as he found happiness in the sport.</p><p>He enrolled in the Legend High School in Parker for his high school education and got a chance to play basketball for their team easily as it was quite a new school. White quickly got popular among his teammates as he progressed very well.</p><p>He later joined the University of Colorado, where he obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Business Management.&nbsp;</p><h2>Derrick White | Basketball Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Derrick White joined the Legend High School in Colorado as a 5’6″ freshman because of which he was not quite impressive to the team management in the beginning.</p><p>But the coach Kevin Boley saw high prospects in him, so he guided him well. As a result, White was highly motivated and began working on his physicality and shot techniques.</p><p>As the Legend’s basketball team was a novice, they initially participated in the 3A level tournament. Later, White led them to the 5A tournament, the state’s highest tournament level.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt; Zydrunas Ilgauskas: Net Worth, Family & Injury >>></strong></a></p><p>Moreover, he grew up over six feet in height as a senior and finished his senior season with an average of 17.1 points and 3.8 rebounds per game.

Just like Culver had presumed, Derrick had a growth spurt due to which he attained the height of 6 feet 4 inches before his first season began.</p><p>Hence, he played for around three college seasons for the Lions in the NCAA Division II competition.</p><p>Each year he made tremendous progress, and consequently, he got an opportunity to play for the University of Colorado Boulder’s team, the Colorado Buffaloes, in his final college season.&nbsp;</p><p>He finished his senior season with an average of 18.1 points and 4.1 rebounds per game, appearing in 34 matches.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>The San Antonio Spurs selected White with the twenty-ninth overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft.

He had recorded 14.4 points and 5.6 assists per game in his last season with the Spurs.</p><p>The San Antonio Spurs had announced his contract extension for four more years in 2021, but they traded White to the Boston Celtics on February 10, 2022.</p><p>Apart from his club career, he was part of the United States national team in the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Some of his awards and achievements include:</p><ul><li>NBA G League champion (2018)</li><li>RMAC Tournament MVP (2015)</li><li>First-team All-Pac-12 (2017)</li><li>RMAC Freshman of The Year (2013)</li><li>NCAA Division II All-American (2014, 2015)</li><li>First-team All-RMAC (2014, 2015)</li></ul><h2>Derrick White | Net Worth & Earnings</h2><p>One of the best young recent players, Derrick White, has an estimated net worth of around $2 million.</p><p>It has been around half-decade since he entered the NBA, and he earns very well through the league games.
