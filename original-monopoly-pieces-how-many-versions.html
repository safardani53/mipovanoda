But what are the original Monopoly pieces and how many different versions are there.
What are the original Monopoly pieces? Since Monopoly was introduced in the 1930s, many of the playing pieces have come and gone.
Some have stuck around since its launch, and others have been ditched.
Monopoly enthusiasts will know that there used to be six items in the famous playing game’s line-up."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You can always 'un-mortgage' them later in the game."</p><h3>2.&nbsp;Cause a housing shortage</h3><p>Never bother buying a hotel, houses are far more valuable - and limited.</p><p>This strategy is one Jessica shares with <a href=# rel=noopener>Imgur user Elpher</a>, who&nbsp;says it's a little known fact that the Monopoly box only contains 32 houses and 12 hotels.</p><p>If you can afford to put four houses on each, that's only eight properties in total.</p><p>Elpher says: "The goal is to gain a second monopoly, and buy enough houses to create a housing shortage, effectively locking down the game for the other players."</p><h3>3. Go to jail - and stay there</h3><p>Prison seems like the ultimate punishment, and most of us can't wait to get out of jail.</p><p>But towards the end, the best strategy is to stay in jail and rake in the cash - while not risking landing on anyone else's squares.</p><p>Natalie says:&nbsp;"In the early game you want to get out of jail as soon as possible.</p><p>"But once all the property squares have been bought sometimes the best thing is to wait patiently in jail.</p><p>"At the later stages of the game, it's better to be behind bars so you can still collect but don't land on expensive squares."</p><p>It may not seem the&nbsp;funnest way to win - but, according to Natalie, it is the most effective.</p><h3>4. NEVER buy Park Lane</h3><p>For many, they're the most sought after squares on the board - but Natalie advises avoiding the purple properties.</p><p>They may have come with sky-high rents, but they cost a fair bit to buy too.</p><p>And, for reasons we explained earlier, your mates aren't very likely to land on Park Lane.</p><h3>How can you turn it around when you're losing at Monopoly?</h3><p>Going to jail can also be a good strategy if you're close to going bankrupt, and don't want to risk landing on anyone else's properties. Don't stay there forever though.</p><p>Another good, but sneaky, strategy is to form alliances and gang up on strong players.</p><p>Does your dad always win? Why don't you and one of your siblings make a pact to block his monopolies?</p><h3>What's the most landed on property in Monopoly?</h3><p>This is the first question if you're looking to rake in on rent.</p><p>According to the maths boffins, Trafalgar Square is the most landed on property on the cardboard London map - making it the most important one to buy.</p><p>They are working on the basis that the most occupied square is Jail - because of how&nbsp;easily Chance and Community Chest cards, as well as the dreaded Go To Jail square, send people to the clink, combined with the probability of landing there and being Just Visiting.</p><p>There are six different ways to roll a seven, 6 and 1, 1 and 6, 5 and 2, 2 and 5, 4 and 3, and 3 and 4 - making it the most likely roll.</p><p>Seven steps from Jail is the Community Chest, but another seven rolls will land you in the red territory - and on Trafalgar Square.</p><p>The orange properties - on 6, 8 or 9 rolls - are also a smart buy. While the purple squares, despite having the highest rent, are unlikely to be landed on so often.</p><h2>What is the rarest Monopoly piece?</h2><p>The rarest Monopoly pieces are the chess pawn pieces that were made during the war.</p><p>The most difficult ones to find are the ones that were made from paper and sawdust.</p><p>This is because this material made the pieces very fragile and they easily broke, hence why they weren't so popular.</p><p>You'll be lucky if you manage to find a collector who has one of these pieces.</p><p>They need to be handled with care considering their fragility.</p><p>The other rare pieces would be the original pieces that were first produced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4J5gY9wa2inop60qrrApWSmp56kvbC42Ganop2TmsButM6wZKaZnq56t7HRrKCopqNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
