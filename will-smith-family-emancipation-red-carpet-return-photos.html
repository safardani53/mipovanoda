Jada, 51, stunned in a white gown with a long ruffled train that followed her on the carpet. Will and Jada lovingly posed together for some photos and they looked to be in such great spirits. Jada has been Will’s biggest supporter since the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Oscars incident</a> that occurred eight months ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Will-Smith-1st-Red-Carpet-Family-Oscars-MEGA-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>At the 94th Academy Awards, Will got on stage and slapped Chris Rock, 57, who made a joke about Jada’s shaved head, which is a result of her alopecia (hair loss) diagnosis. After the slap, Will went on to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>win the Academy Award</a> for his leading performance in the movie&nbsp;King Richard. Will <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>publicly apologized</a> to Chris in a written <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> post the day after the Oscars. He eventually <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>resigned</a> from the Academy due to his actions, and has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>banned</a> from the Oscars for ten years as punishment. That means he cannot attend the 2023 Academy Awards even if he’s nominated for&nbsp;Emancipation, where he plays a runway slave.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Will’s had to address the Oscars slap while on the press tour for&nbsp;<i>Emancipation.&nbsp;</i>He spoke to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Trevor Noah</strong> </a>in his first&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post-scandal talk show appearance</a>&nbsp;on Nov. 28 and said that there were “many&nbsp;nuances and complexities” in the “horrific” situation with Chris.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“At the end of the day, I just lost it. I guess what I would say is you just never know what somebody’s going through,” the Bad Boys star said. “You just don’t know what’s going on with people. And I was going through something that night. Not that that justifies my behavior at all, but you’re asking what I learned, and it’s that we just got to be nice to each other, man,” Will added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49qZrChnKF6tLnIrZ9mnpGitq3FjJ6kmqaTnr2iwMiopWaqlZl6pK3RqZytZaKawba%2BzWanoaekpMBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
