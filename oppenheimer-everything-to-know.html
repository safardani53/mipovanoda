But [Christopher Nolan] is telling it in a different way. That's all I can say," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Murphy shared that the role felt "immense and terrifying" when it was first presented to him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"But if I felt it was easy, I wouldn't be interested. I do get nervous, anxious and insecure, but then you go, 'F--- it. I have been doing it for 25 years and I have done it before. So just keep going,' " he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Matt Damon</a>, who also stars in the film, shared his take on Oppenheimer in March 2023. "Cillian is phenomenal. He's everything you would want him to be," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Variety</a>.
