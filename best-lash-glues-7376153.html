Here to help you call off your search is the top-rated Lilly Lashes Clear Eyelash Glue. It’s a staple in some of our favorite makeup artists’ kits, and we echo that sentiment. Straight out of the gate, we were impressed by the simple and precise applicator that allows you to control exactly how much product you want to use so that you don’t wind up with a mess.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After applying the glue straight to her lash strip, we noted how quickly it turned tacky, which is ideal for proper placement. Because much like a microwave or treadmill minute, waiting for lash glue to dry to its perfect consistency could not be more frustrating. It quickly gripped to our lash line with ease, and most importantly, the formula goes from white to clear, so it’s very forgiving.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This formula didn’t irritate our eyes at all, even with sensitive skin, nor did it have any harsh or chemical smell like some lash glues can. In fact, it’s ophthalmologist- and dermatologist-tested. Because it dries so quickly, it may be harder for novices to figure out the exact amount of playtime needed to get the lash placement right, but once you do find that sweet spot, the application process becomes a breeze. And others that already have experience with lash glue will appreciate this quick-drying formula.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.16 oz. | <strong>Color: </strong>Clear | <strong>Applicator: </strong>Brush</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=5636 data-sizes=750px alt="Lilly Lashes Clear Brush On Lash Adhesive" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/_e-SAmOJDoAgsytwGVro4Gx5gWI=/fit-in/1500x5636/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-false-lashes-glue-test-lilly-clear-jthompson-0287-3-8372d353b523404b8b78c201b5e7ea72.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4247 data-sizes=750px alt="Lilly Lashes Clear Brush-On Lash Adhesive" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/-82ZZKc9mWm5QcVkABZc9q8cyqk=/fit-in/1500x4247/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-product-lilly-lashes-clear-eyelash-glue-tstaples-3156-cdbdbc5a454b47b9a082c83012e59dd3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-duo-brush-on-lash-adhesive></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Duo Brush-On Lash Adhesive</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Duo Brush-On Lash Adhesive" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/jHgLFHo8kU6yXoKH4vZrkV1fdug=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/duo-brush-on-lash-adhesive-404c05e48c0d4a6291972d55b7ab5e9a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hold/Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Long-lasting formula is easy to apply and keeps lashes secure</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Different shades and formulas based on preference</p></li><li readability=1><p>Enriched with vitamins A,C, and E</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This bargain drugstore lash glue is everywhere for a reason —&nbsp;it really works! It also proves that price doesn’t always equal efficacy. There are several different versions, including formulas for strip lashes, individual lashes, and tinted options. We reviewed the clear formula for strip lashes that comes with an applicator brush. Similar to our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>favorite lash-boosting serums</a>, it has good-for-you ingredients like vitamins A, C, and E.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">During testing, we found it was easy to apply the glue to the lashes, but it would be helpful if the brush was smaller; we had an issue with some of the glue getting on the eyelid rather than the lash line because the brush had a little too much product on it. All in all, we would have preferred a thinner applicator in order to target the lash line, but once the glue dried, our lashes felt secure and it ended up lasting longer than some other glues we tested.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.18 oz. | <strong>Color: </strong>Clear<strong> </strong>| <strong>Applicator: </strong>Brush</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-2 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=5636 data-sizes=750px alt="DUO Brush-On Lash Adhesive" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/WI4qRYmLkcPDC4qYxTaIDy9dbV0=/fit-in/1500x5636/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-false-lashes-glue-test-duo-brush-adhesive-jthompson-0371-3-9e19b64bc30f416485e82d6d07607c9f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=5636 data-sizes=750px alt="DUO Brush-On Lash Adhesive" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/6dog6J9-chF4Tfy2JoL6yEdZR6I=/fit-in/1500x5636/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-false-lashes-glue-test-duo-brush-adhesive-jthompson-0146-3-3de3a0fca2e94748bd2465a4d587fe1d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-pr-pro-eyelash-glue></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Lightweight</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>PÜR Pro Eyelash Glue</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="P&amp;Uuml;R Pro Eyelash Glue" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KFUNGHlpQCmHwJkq28g_hyJT_w8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PuR-Pro-Eyelash-Glue-984010d40abb4bd2885e1852ea40834f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hold/Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re applying false lashes, you are probably going to an event where you not only want your lashes to stay on, but you also don’t want to deal with them falling off. Enter: this waterproof formula. We appreciated how lightweight this glue was — it was barely detectable after applying. We also noted that not much was needed, so the tube will last you a long time. It held our lashes on well, but we did notice that because it was so lightweight, it may not hold a thicker or heavier pair of lashes as well as other options. While more waterproof than others, we found it wasn't entirely waterproof in our testing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.18 oz. | <strong>Color: </strong>Clear |<strong> Applicator: </strong>Brush</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-4 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=5636 data-sizes=750px alt="PÃR Pro Eyelash Glue" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/VAwCmRB9p9g3_J0UcK8c57ITEtc=/fit-in/1500x5636/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-false-lashes-glue-test-pur-pro-jthompson-0312-3-89732e45b00343ee9aa19f8a970cf902.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=5636 data-sizes=750px alt="PÃR Pro Eyelash Glue" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/tTjTxfrJxeRa8D7wLPrSsvluV9g=/fit-in/1500x5636/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-false-lashes-glue-test-pur-pro-jthompson-0315-3-0e303534c8154017b649ce719353e127.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-beginners-sephora-collection-brush-tip-lash-adhesive></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Beginners</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sephora Collection Brush-tip Lash Adhesive</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Collection Brush-tip Lash Adhesive" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/e_jUBntKdeQDS4mUHa_7RwFdHdw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sephora-collection-brush-tip-lash-adhesive-d387795f32ad4538b503d159933a0dcf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Hold/Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Wear</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Tacky formula comes with an easy-to-use applicator</p></li><li readability=0><p>Takes longer to dry compared to others we tested, meaning you have more time for proper placement</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Black tint complements eyeliner or eyeshadow makeup looks</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Smoky eye lovers</a>, this is the lash glue for you. Sometimes clear and white formulas can dull an intricate eye look, but this inky black version only adds to the drama and blends seamlessly with glam shadow. We found that the applicator brush made it easy to apply and resulted in a mess-free application. It’s a good choice for beginners because the formula is nice and tacky, plus it gives you a little extra time to play with where you want to stick your lashes before it dries completely.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing to note is that after it dried, it did feel like it tugged at the skin at points, but it was not a deal-breaker.

Instead of applying it straight to the lash band, you draw on your eyeliner as you normally would, but with this formula, you can stick your lashes right on top. We love any multitasking product that helps us skip a step and get out the door quicker, which is why this product may soon become one of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>your favorite eyeliners</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found that the glue wasn’t as sticky as expected but it held our lashes without an issue. However, it did take a few coats for it to be as sticky as we wanted, but once the lashes were on, they stayed in place. Its felt tip makes it super easy to add more and touch-up certain areas after lashes are applied, too. If you’ve tried doing that with traditional brush and glue formulas, you know that it can get messy quickly.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0.03<strong> </strong>oz. | <strong>Color: </strong>Black |<strong> Applicator: </strong>Felt tip pen</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-8 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=5621 data-sizes=750px alt="D'Lashes DâAdhesive Felt Tip Eyeliner Pen" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/m54x_9dS-t3ppsIHVN59JHwR54U=/fit-in/1500x5621/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-false-lashes-glue-test-d-adhesive-felt-tip-eyeliner-pen-jthompson-0188-3-2e80a43a49b14109bb308e3d6fb579b1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4258 data-sizes=750px alt="D'Lashes D'Adhesive Felt Tip Eyeliner Pen" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/NXWMBcWqzOD6Z1rOUCWkA7G04x4=/fit-in/1500x4258/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-product-d-lashes-d-adhesive-felt-tip-eyeliner-pen-tstaples-461-e627056c4781496aa1eb0cc6cce55913.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-lash-glues></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying Lash Glues</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Formulation</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In an effort to not get overwhelmed, know what your specific needs are and look for formulas that are going to give you those results. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Ashunta Sheriff</a>, celebrity makeup artist and founder of her eponymous brand, recommends taking into account your eyes and what formulation will work best for them.

After that, we watched a step-by-step video demonstration to help with each application. If the glue called for direct application to the lash, we observed how easily the glue went onto the lash band and then noted how quickly the glue dried and set. After 10 minutes, we noted if the glue dried completely and recorded how the glue looked and felt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We rated each lash glue on a scale of 1 to 5 based on the attributes of wearability, hold, and comfort, and cited any observations, including any changes we would make to the product and whether we would recommend it to others.&nbsp;The products with the highest average ratings earned a PEOPLE Tested badge of approval.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-8cdc24bb-aed4-495b-bf69-77ccdc7e65e6></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What glue is best for false lashes?</span></p><p>Everyone’s needs are going to be a little different when searching for the right lash glue formula, but ultimately the best glue is one that’s going to hold your lashes in place sans irritation. A favorite amongst most faux lash wearers is one with an applicator brush that allows you to control how much glue you’re applying. There are squeeze tube versions and felt tip formulas, too, that may take some getting used to but feel second-nature once you get the hang of it — it’s sort of like riding a bike.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How long does lash glue last?</span></p><p>Some formulas last longer than others and, of course, your application habits come into play, too, but most lash glues will last about six months. You have to be quite diligent in how you close the tube, though, because if it’s exposed to air, the glue will dry out faster. Another issue with leaving a tube open is that it can spill easily, so make sure to screw the cap on tight. If you notice your lash brush getting dirty from your eye makeup, that’s another sign to toss and replace it, since bacteria can get trapped inside the tube.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can lash glue damage your eyes?</span></p><p>The short answer is yes, but only if you’re not being careful with how you apply it or if you’re using an unsafe, old, or tainted formula. Many of these lash glues are irritant-free, meaning they’re formulated without latex and other harmful ingredients. Experts say to avoid getting the glue in your eyes and to remove the lashes per the instructions to avoid damaging your natural eyelashes.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=3></span> If you have sensitive skin, it is always encouraged to patch test on your arm to ensure that there’s no adverse reaction before actual application. Out of these top formulas, none of our testers had issues, including contact wearers or those with sensitive skin. Additionally, Sheriff says it’s also important to give your own lashes a break every now and then. “I wear lashes a lot, but I also give my eyes a break and allow them to breathe so it’s all about balance, because glue will break lashes over time with overuse,” Sheriff says.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-people-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is PEOPLE Tested?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We created the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE Tested seal of approval</a> to help you find the very best products for your life.
