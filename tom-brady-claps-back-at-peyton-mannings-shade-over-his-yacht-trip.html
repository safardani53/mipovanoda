My flight got canceled. I was in [seat] 36F. Has Tom sat in 36F on a Delta flight, what do you think, A.J.?” Manning asked cohost <strong>A.J. Hawk</strong>, to which he replied, “Probably not in about 30 years, Peyton.”</p><p>Manning, <a href=#>who retired from the NFL in 2016</a>, noted that on his Delta flight he was put in an “exit row,” which had one major downside … the temperature.</p><p>“I swear the door was open. It was as cold as I’ve ever been. I’ve played in some cold-weather games, I’ve been in Green Bay, played in New England,” he continued. “I asked the flight attendant, ‘Is there a warmer blanket?’ She was so disappointed that I was complaining about being cold, she wouldn’t give me a blanket, and I was like, ‘I’m just freezing, ma’am.’ I roughed it through in 36F and made it to my destination.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Manning and Brady have bantered publicly. In June 2022, Brady posted an unflattering video of himself practicing in which his forehead and nose were enlarged on camera. The former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback then roasted Manning in the caption — because Manning is known for having a larger forehead.</p><p>“The kids over on tiktok are calling this the Peyton angle 😂 Rude!” <a href=#>Brady wrote while sharing the video via X</a>. Peyton’s brother — retired New York Giants quarterback <a href=#><strong>Eli Manning</strong></a> — loved the dig, writing, “Your best joke!!” <a href=#>and reposted the clip</a> to his socials.</p><p>One year prior, Peyton was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and couldn’t help himself from throwing a little shade. “Next year, acceptance speeches will probably shrink to four minutes,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Peyton began his August 2021 speech</a>. “Speaking of rivals, my good friend Tom Brady is here tonight. By the time Tom Brady is inducted, in his first year of eligibility in the year 2035, he’ll only have time to post his acceptance speech to his Instagram account.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>All jokes aside, the two legendary NFL players have nothing but respect for their time on the gridiron together. “He always brought out the best in me and that’s why our games are some of my favorites,” Peyton said of Brady on a January 2020 episode of his show <a href=# rel=noopener>Peyton’s Place</a>.</p><p>Brady agreed, telling his longtime opponent, “They’re the most memorable games in my career. I think I can remember all of them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp51ir7Otw7JknKSRpcBursCcomaZpGK9psXTqKVmpZGju6q6xqxkrKCRmbJuu9WeqWagmah6uq3CoatmrKKevXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
