And one online profile he does appear to have is a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn page</a> –– and it reveals that he’s an account manager for Nike in California.</p><p>His LinkedIn profile doesn’t have any other information about his job history before that, but we know that he was once a basketball player too. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultimate Hoops</a>, his position was as a small forward.

He went out of his way to ensure that it would be a day to remember by teaming up with her son, Hudson — whom she shares with ex-husband Josh Hughes — to come up with the most brilliant proposal idea.</p><p>Madison told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> in October 2021: “My son and my fiancé, they ended up planning this. When [Brett] asked my son if he could be his stepdad and be part of our lives, my son had one request. That was that he would be part of the proposal. It was so, so sweet.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Obviously, when Brett finally popped the question, she said yes.</p><p>Unfortunately, fans of Southern Charm won't be able to watch Brett in action during any episodes of the show though. During an Instagram live stream on Madison's page, he revealed (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Tea</a>) that spending time in front of reality TV cameras simply wasn’t his thing.</p><p>And according to the outlet, Madison also admitted in an Instagram Live that she wouldn’t be inviting any of her Southern Charm co-stars to attend her wedding either, as they only want to invite family.</p><p>It’s clear that the couple wants to maintain a sense of privacy when it comes to their big day.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brett Randle seems totally ready to become a stepfather.</h2><p>Madison has posted several pictures of herself with Brett and her son on Instagram.
