These people should just never leave Arkansas, as they aren't going to step out of their comfort zone no matter where they go."</p><p>Other fans took the opposite approach, with one person reasoning: "I'm not defending these folks, but I go to McDonald's in other countries. Not for every meal, but at least once."</p><p>A second mentioned: "European McDonalds really are a completely different experience."</p><p>While a third wrote: "On the plus side, the tour guide did most of the talking in this one, so mostly all we heard from the Lost Boy was 'wow,' 'cool,' and 'McDonald's.'"</p><h2>BREAKING THE RULES</h2><p>Italy was just one of the group's stops during their international travels.</p><p>They've also been documenting their journey through London and Switzerland.</p><p>James and <a href=#>Jana</a>'s vacation abroad is a bit of a shock to fans because the two are breaking from the strict rules established by conservative parents&nbsp;<a href=#>Jim Bob</a>, 57,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Duggar</a>, 56.</p><p>The parents have banned their children from living in or visiting major cities while growing up.</p><p>Despite this, the siblings have been exploring all the countries have to offer, with James even <a href=#>visiting a tavern</a> - another forbidden establishment for the Duggar kids.</p><h2>ADVENTURES ABROAD</h2><p>James also took fans along on his snowy exploration through Switzerland with his friend Elijah.</p><p>In a carousel on his Instagram page, the first photo showed James looking out beyond the beautiful snow-covered mountains.</p><p>A subsequent video showed off the gorgeous view from above.</p><p>The reality star also shared photos of his food, including a pasta bowl.</p><p>Decked out in ski gear and sunglasses, another snap showed James and Elijah riding a ski lift.</p><p>Next was a video of the friends walking down a snow-covered street at night, with blaring club music.</p><p>The posts came just a day after Elijah posted a video of James sitting on the slopes, with a caption reading: "Absolutely amazing!!!"</p><p>Days earlier, the pair got into a <a href=#>silly exchange</a> after confusion over their location during a layover in London.</p><p>James told his followers: "We're here in the state of..."</p><p>"State?" questioned his friend.</p><p>"The country... whatever this is, of London," said James.</p><p>"It's England!" Elijah said.</p><p>"No, we're in London, though," James tried to argue.</p><p>"It's the country of England, though!" said Elijah.</p><p>The banter sparked a slew of comments online, with some calling the duo's interaction "embarrassing."</p><h2>JANA'S MYSTERY MAN</h2><p>Among James' social media posts was also an eyebrow-raising photo of his sister Jana, 33, with her <a href=#>rumored secret boyfriend</a> in Italy.</p><p>Viewers noticed the unidentified male sitting alongside Jana in one snapshot, and he again appeared in other photos from the trip.</p><p>While visiting the Pantheon and the Fontana di Trevi-Rome, the mystery man popped up in the background while the&nbsp;TLC&nbsp;alum made a funny face at the camera.</p><p>In&nbsp;an online thread, fans claimed the mysterious stranger might be Jana's "potential love interest."</p><p>One fan claimed: "Heâ€™s the only one on the trip that isnâ€™t a family member."</p><p>Another fan speculated: "He could be a long-time family friend. That's how they know each other."</p><p>A third fan suggested: "She has been surrounded by sisters getting engaged, married, and pregnant in quick succession. Looks like it's her turn now."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>A fourth person wrote: "He looks younger than her, but I donâ€™t see a problem with someone 24 being with a 33-year-old if they are mature, have an income, all that."</p><p>A fifth chimed in: "I think Jana has taken herself off the market."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/jim-bob-michelle-duggar-recent-661442949-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/swiss-diss-inside-rebel-james-796468235-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/duggar-fans-make-wild-prediction-795213389-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZGqAcoSWaJuun5eWv262wKacrGWalruiecWroJ6mlKh6pq3ToqWgZZSeu6%2Bx0WaboquXqsC1tc2gZKCdpJbEosWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
