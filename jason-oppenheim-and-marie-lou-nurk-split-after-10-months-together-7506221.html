"Long distance relationships can be tough, but we're both committed to making it work. We make sure to communicate regularly and make time for each other despite the distance."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued: "While it's not always easy, we both believe that our love is worth the effort.

Whether it's on social media, in the press or on TV, one is much more quickly judged," she explained, adding that she didn't have time to prepare for her&nbsp;Selling Sunset&nbsp;cameo. "On a reality show, it's actually&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>better not to think too much about it</a>&nbsp;so it's not unnatural."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Charlotte Lobry @charlottelobry</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier this month, the pair <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>briefly sparked marriage rumors</a>.

The images, by photographer&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Charlotte Lobry</a>, show the couple playfully running and lounging beside a luxurious hotel pool, as well as posing in the front seat of a vintage car.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The post was initially captioned, "Here's to a lifetime of adventures," but quickly changed to, "You always make me smile," after congratulatory messages began to fill the comments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oppenheim set the record straight in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE: "Lou and I quickly realized that our post on Instagram made it look like we had just been married. We received numerous congratulatory texts, as well as angry texts from friends asking why they weren't invited, so quickly changed the caption! All these photos were from an event that we went to together a couple of months ago."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5qWwLC6jKinqZ2enbKquYyapZ1lnZa%2FqrGMpaauZZ6qv6x50qmjoqxdlrO1sdFmaGllnaS7tbTSZquon5Wptaa%2BjHBsaW5iZ34%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
