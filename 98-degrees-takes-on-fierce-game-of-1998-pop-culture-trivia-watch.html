More than two decades after they rose to fame with their breakout single “Because of You,” Nick and Drew Lachey, Justin Jeffre and Jeff Timmons are still just as passionate about their craft. 
The band went on hiatus in 2002 but reunited in 2012 to release a new album, 2.0. Ten years later, they’re back in the studio making new music, in the process of re-recording their masters and gearing up for a25th Anniversary Tour."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Having a good time — and <a href=#>enjoying the fruits of their labor</a>. “We’re more relaxed,” Jeff, the band’s founding member, told Us. “Everything is more fun.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/98-Degrees-Take-on-a-Fierce-Game-of-Trivia-on-1998-Pop-Culture-Main.jpg><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Fun was certainly had while playing Us’ 1998 trivia game, which included questions about major pop culture events, sports, politics and of course, who was dominating the music charts at the time.</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“‘Because of You!’” Drew buzzed in when asked to name Billboard’s Top 10 hottest singles from 1998. While the guys recalled their own song-breaking records, they weren’t as quick to remember any others.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“‘Music’ by Madonna?” Drew guessed, to which Jeff corrected him: “No. That’s ’99 [or] 2000.”&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“‘Because of You’, ‘My Heart Will Go On’ and ‘Livin La Vida Loca!’” Nick guessed enthusiastically — but also incorrectly. Drew also tried “‘Tearin’ Up My Heart’” <a href=#>by fellow boyband ‘NSync</a>, but once again got his years wrong. “That was ’97,” Jeff quipped. “Sorry, Charlie.”&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Shows you guys <a href=#>how hyper-focused we were back in ’98</a> of our ourselves,” Nick joked.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>They have the right. In their heyday, 98 Degrees sold nearly 15 million records, had four top 10 singles and regularly graced the covers of teen magazines everywhere. They were one of the hottest bands of the ‘90s — but recording hit after hit wasn’t always easy — and <a href=#>sometimes required strange vocal tricks</a> to keep their sound feeling crisp.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/98-Degrees-Take-on-a-Fierce-Game-of-Trivia-on-1998-Pop-Culture-Inline.jpg><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I was a little under the weather when we recorded [“I Do (Cherish You)”],” Nick explained to Us, revealing that he took a “tip” from record producer <strong>Keith Thomas</strong> to remedy the problem.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“He said, ‘Try eating Lays potato chips. Like, the old-school Lays potato chips. The oil from the chips will help, kind of, coat your throat,’” Nick recalled. “He said, ‘It works for <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Williams</strong></a>, it will work for you.’ So, I tried it. I still do it to this day.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Nick may need to turn to Lays soon.
