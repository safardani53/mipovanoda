Amber worries that Amanda doesn’t know how to just be a person and a mom without also being a partner. She has spent all of her adult life as a wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0605_amandawilhelm_10-1024x576.png><p>“He passed away early 2022,” Amanda clarified.</p><p>She did not specify, but his obituary did — he died in mid-March of 2022. Fifteen months ago.</p><p>Amanda then detailed that “filming for the show took place end of 2022 early 2023.” She began filming about eight months after his passing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Amanda also delved into her new, on-screen relationship.</p><p>“Also, my children knew Razvan as being my friend only, nothing more,” she claimed.</p><p>Well, Amanda didn’t tell them more than that. As we saw on the show, kids pick up on things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0605_amandawilhelm_17-1024x576.png><p>“Regarding me leaving them to go to Romania,” Amanda continued, “they were perfectly well taken care of.”</p><p>The kids were with her aunt “and stayed in our home with family so that their regular routine was never interrupted.”</p><p>Amanda affirmed: “My children are my world, and I would never do anything to cause them any trauma or pain.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0605_amandawilhelm_03-1024x576.png><p>“I was never looking to replace their father,” Amanda emphasized.</p><p>She added: “or even gave them the impression I was romantically involved with someone.”</p><p>Then, Amanda delved into alarm that viewers feel over the very physical role that her late husband’s ashes play in her kids’ day-to-day lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0605_amandawilhelm_05-1024x576.png><p>The family brings this cremation urn with them on family visits, on car rides, and even on picnics.</p><p>“Lastly, if my children wanted to carry their father’s ashes around with them for five years,” Amanda wrote, “I’d let them.”</p><p>That is certainly sweet. At least, her intentions are very good. The concern is mostly over whether this is healthy for her young children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0605_amandawilhelm_16-1024x576.png><p>Amanda was responding to a cacophony of “feedback” from fans and bloggers. And, obviously, some were downright mean-spirited.</p><p>Some had very nuanced concerns, not just about her kids but about her own mental state.</p><p>In fact, many of these worries echoed those that her sister, Amber, expressed. Amanda’s rebound romance is probably not healthy for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0605_amandawilhelm_11-1024x576.png><p>Meanwhile, some fans are speculating that Amanda accidentally spoiled her season.</p><p>Notably, her message refers to Razvan in the past tense.</p><p>She is describing events from last autumn and early this year. So … let’s not jump to conclusions.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WDcK3MmqWdmV2stq20xKWkZpyVm7KvsNJmp5qqlaPBqrrGZqmemp%2Bqu6V50aikmqaTmnqistOeqWaakZi4ra3SoWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
