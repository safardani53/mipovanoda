Also his travel reality show with William Shatner and Terry Bradshaw, Better Late Than Never, was some of the finest reality TV content ever made.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Scott Baio (Charles "Chachi" Arcola)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>Chachi didn't show up until Season 4, but he was so popular he snagged a spin-off with his love interest, Richie's sister, Joanie.

She was also the voice of Grandma Squarepants!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Anson Williams (Warren "Potsie" Weber)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>Like his buddy Ron Howard, Anson also developed a passion for directing and has helmed episodes of such popular shows as Lizzie McGuire, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Melrose Place, Beverly Hills 90210, and The Secret Life of the American Teenager.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Don Most (Ralph Malph)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>Much of Don's recent work has been voice acting and he also recently put out a Christmas album of swing music.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In Memoriam: Erin Moran, Tom Bosley, Al Molinaro, Pat Morita</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>Sadly, some of the cast are no longer with us.
