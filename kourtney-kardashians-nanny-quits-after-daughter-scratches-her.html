You can go home,’ and I said, ‘You can’t fire our nanny.’”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a> chimed in, calling the situation “much more serious” than Kourtney realized. “I have six kids,” the momager, 63, said. “Not once in my entire life did anyone ever have a complaint like this.

Mason I can take [things] away [and] he cares. Penelope doesn’t care. Kids are different.”</p><p>This led Jenner’s boyfriend, <strong>Corey Gamble</strong>, to say that <a href=#>he would give the little one “a spanking”</a> if she scratched him. He and the Flip It Like Disick star then argued over his comments.</p><p>When the talent manager, 38, said, “Whipping is that discipline,” the Talentless creator replied, “Don’t ever talk about a child like that!
