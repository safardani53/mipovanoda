Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch, was also targeted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mulvaney, who has more than 10.8 million followers, found herself at the controversy's center. The video — which featured the social media personality announcing a March Madness-related contest in partnership with Bud Light — was met with immediate backlash against Bud Light's decision to partner with someone in the LGBTQ community.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On social media, Bud Light critics called for a "boycott" of the brand, in addition to Anheuser-Busch's portfolio of products, which include Budweiser, Busch, Stella Artois, Michelob Ultra and Hoegarden. Others shared videos of themselves shooting beer cans and lighting beer boxes on fire.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bud Light is among other retail brands including<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> Adidas and Target</a> that have been subject to a small but vitriolic community of people who target them for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>marketing to LGBTQ. consumers</a>&nbsp;— which has included harassing retail workers and calling in bomb threats. And the brand's responses (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>in the case of Target and Bud Light, to pull back on their marketing efforts to the LGBTQ community)</a> have caused disappointment in people with more inclusive points of view.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Bud Light’s missteps felt like a betrayal to both its liberal and conservative customers, and that trust is going to take months, if not years, to rebuild,” Daniel Korschun, an associate professor of marketing at Drexel University’s LeBow College of Business, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told the </a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>New York Times</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the months that followed, Anheuser-Busch has released a statement acknowledging the controversy. The company's CEO expressed his intentions in a letter posted to the Anheuser-Busch website on April 14. Mulvaney has also responded to the matter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for everything to know about the Bud Light controversy, from when it began to what's been said about it.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-did-the-bud-light-controversy-begin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When did the Bud Light controversy begin?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dylan Mulvaney/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On April 1, when Dylan Mulvaney — an influencer who has 1.8 million <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> followers and who is transgender — uploaded a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>video</a> to her social media account to promote a Bud Light contest.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The clip, which was less than a minute long, focused primarily on promoting Bud Light's “Easy Carry&nbsp;Contest,” a $15,000 giveaway tied to March Madness sponsored by the beer brand. Throughout the video, Mulvaney poked fun at her lack of sports knowledge, particularly basketball.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Happy March Madness!!

On April 27 she spoke to her fans and addressed the anti-trans rhetoric she and others were receiving.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I grew up in a conservative family and I'm extremely privileged because they still love me very much," she began.

I just don't think that's right."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The anti-trans activist went on to express her concerns amid the "loud" comments being made about her — specifically, that she was "nervous" her followers "were going to start believing the things that they were saying."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Mulvaney said she's going to "trust" that the people who "know" her and her heart "won't listen to that noise" — and also thanked supporters who might not fully understand or identify with her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mulvaney concluded by listing what she's interested in moving forward, like "making people laugh" and "to never stop learning."

From time to time we produce unique commemorative cans for fans and for brand influencers, like Dylan Mulvaney."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The statement also clarified, "this commemorative can was a gift to celebrate a personal milestone and is not for sale to the general public."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Anheuser-Busch also announced in late April the exit of two marketing executives and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said in early May</a>&nbsp;that it would focus its marketing campaigns on sports and music.
