Julian suffered from mental health problems for years and was receiving treatment at a facility in Long Beach, California, at the time he took his own life.</p><p>In May 2015, Radar Online reported that Kristoff and Mia filed a wrongful death <a href=#>lawsuit</a> against La Casa Mental Health Hospital for allegedly failing to prevent Julian’s death.&nbsp;The lawsuit was settled out of court in July 2017, according to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>.</p><p>Three years after his son’s suicide, the Christmas Cruise star was hospitalized after <a href=#>undergoing a psych evaluation</a>. “To all of mi [sic] IG peeps. Thanks for throwing out a life preserver,” he wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a> in November 2017. “Words cannot express the gratitude that I feel to have so much love that you bathe me in…anoint me with…cloak me with. I am humbled.”</p><p>He continued: “Life is precious. I look forward to continuing this journey together with all of you…us. Because at the end of the day, at the magic hour, we are warmed with an all knowing presence of light and love. My heart beats to the music of our creation. You are an integral piece of my personal spiritual puzzle, as I hope I am to yours. I love you…forever. #gratitude #friends #life #journey #love #yr #cbs.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kristoff, who was best known for playing Neil Winters on The Young and the Restless since 1991, announced his <a href=#>engagement</a> to Russian model <strong>Kseniya Mikhaleva</strong> in September 2018.
