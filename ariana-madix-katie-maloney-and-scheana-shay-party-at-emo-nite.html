The ladies started their night with drinks and dinner at SugarTaco, where they enjoyed spicy watermelon margaritas (dubbed the “Revenge Dress”) before they headed to Emo Nite venue, Avalon.</p><p>Once in the club, the ladies hit the DJ booth, jamming out to Paramore, My Chemical Romance, All American Rejects and more punk pop hits. At one point, Shay even led the crowd in a “F–k Tom” chant, per social media footage.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Mod Sun</strong></a>, <strong>Fefe Dobson</strong> and Simple Plan drummer<strong> Chuck Comeau</strong> also stopped by to rock out at the event.</p><p>The night out came just days after Madix, 37, released a new line of Team Ariana merchandise. The official shop includes clothing, drink ware and accessories that read “It’s not me, it’s you,” “Bad Bitches Only” and “Best F–king Friend.”</p><p>Madix split from<a href=#><strong> Tom Sandoval</strong></a>, ending their <a href=#>9-year romance</a>, in early March after learning of his affair with <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules costar</a><a href=#><strong> Raquel Leviss</strong></a>.

In a clip shared via social media from the outing, Kathan, 32, <a href=#>shared footage of the group booing</a> as the bar played news coverage of Scandoval.</p><p>“Any questions?” she wrote alongside the video of Ariana’s friends making aggressive thumbs down motions with photos of Sandoval, 40, and Raquel, 28, splashed across the screens.</p><p>Both the restauranteur and former pageant queen apologized to Ariana via statements on social media, but the status of their relationship after their infidelity was made public is unclear.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It started off as a friendship and turned into something more,” Leviss <a href=#>told TMZ</a> on March 22. “We’re just trying to get through these next through steps and make amends and hear everybody out. I know a lot of people are angry. So just getting through these next few steps and not putting a label on anything. We’re just kind of taking a break for now.”</p><p>Scroll down to see more photos of the Pump Rules women at Emo Nite:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkrrO1wKeYZqWRmba5ecqaq6KdXaKurbvNnrBmmZ6ZerSvx56Yp5ldqLWixYypmKusqWKutXnEpqZmppmpsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
