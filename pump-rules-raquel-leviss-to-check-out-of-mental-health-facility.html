Us confirmed that same month that Madix, 38, and Sandoval, 40, <a href=#>split after nine years together</a> once she learned of his infidelity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pump-Rules-Raquel-Leviss-to-Check-Out-of-Mental-Health-Facility-378.jpg><p>“Raquel and her family decided before the relationship was discovered that she would enter a voluntary facility for mental health counseling,” Leviss’ rep told Us in an April statement, noting that their client was <a href=#>not seeking treatment for substance abuse</a>. “Raquel had planned to admit herself before the VPR reunion was taped on March 23. She was scheduled to go in pre-reunion but decided she wanted to finish her filming commitment. Bravo and production were aware and in support of her journey towards better mental health.”</p><p>During the Pump Rules reunion, which aired in May, Leviss dropped a bombshell and confirmed that Sandoval asked her to <a href=#>lie about their relationship timeline</a>, which actually began in August 2022. She noted that the second time the two were intimate was at <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Brock Davies</strong>’ August 2022 wedding</a>. (Leviss also hooked up with Sandoval’s business partner, <a href=#><strong>Tom Schwartz</strong></a>, during the same trip.)</p><p>“I know the reason why Tom wanted to lie about it is because it’s a really bad look to hook up with someone’s boyfriend in their own house when they’ve gone out of town. Especially for like a funeral of all things,” Leviss <a href=#>said in a confessional interview</a> that was taped after the reunion sit-down with other cast members. “So, like, I don’t know if this is f–king killed my soul. I am so sick of lying, I hate it. I hate being deceitful. It’s horrible.” Leviss was referring to her and Sandoval’s hookup in September 2022 <a href=#>while Madix was mourning her grandmother’s death</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pump-Rules-Raquel-Leviss-to-Check-Out-of-Mental-Health-Facility-2-e1688152254861.jpg><p>Despite receiving intense backlash for her romance with Sandoval, Leviss has remained committed to bettering herself following the season 10 drama.</p><p>“Upon the completion of filming the reunion, Raquel entered a voluntary inpatient behavioral health and trauma facility and remains there to date — 68 days and counting,” <a href=#>an insider exclusively told Us on June 8</a>. “Her treatment is helping her learn the basis of her decisions and to grow from her mistakes with the hope of making better choices and becoming a better person.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this month, a source told Us that <a href=#>Leviss “hasn’t decided whether or not she wants to come back to the show”</a> following all the drama on and off camera. Her hesitation, however, hasn’t stopped production from moving forward. <a href=#><strong>Lala Kent</strong></a> revealed on Monday, June 26, that <a href=#>she was getting “anxiety” ahead of season 11’s start</a> on Wednesday, June 28.</p><p>“I’m just like, ‘Oh, we’re really in it again,’” Kent, 32, said during an Amazon livestream. “We usually have so much time to process — things change a lot — but nope.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaprZ2lerPBy56qZqqRpsKmuIylnK%2Bho6h6tbuMnJ%2Bem5tivLbAjKidZqWVo8GiuIyhnJqkpJ16p63CoqOirKlk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
