He always put family before self. He looked forward to any chance to connect with his grandchildren, and had a unique bond with each of them,” his son Peter McCallum shared in a statement on behalf of the family. “He and his youngest grandson, Whit, 9, could often be found in the corner of a room at family parties having deep philosophical conversations.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The statement continued, “He was a true renaissance man—he was fascinated by science and culture and would turn those passions into knowledge.&nbsp;For example, he was capable of conducting a symphony orchestra and (if needed) could actually perform an autopsy, based on his decades-long studies for his role on NCIS.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sonja Flemming/CBS</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“After returning from the hospital to their apartment, I asked my mother if she was OK before she went to sleep.&nbsp;Her answer was simply, 'Yes. But I do wish we had had a chance to grow old together.'&nbsp;She is 79, and dad just turned 90.&nbsp;The honesty in that emotion shows how vibrant their beautiful relationship and daily lives were, and that somehow, even at 90, Daddy never grew old.”&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Michael Yarish/CBS via Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">NCIS executive producers Steven D. Binder and David North also shared their memories of working with McCallum.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“For over twenty years, David McCallum endeared himself to audiences around the world playing the wise, quirky, and sometimes enigmatic, Dr. Donald 'Ducky' Mallard,” they shared in a statement. “But as much as his fans may have loved him, those who worked side by side with David loved him that much more. He was a scholar and a gentleman, always gracious, a consummate professional, and never one to pass up a joke.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They shared, “From day one, it was an honor to work with him and he never let us down. He was, quite simply, a legend. He was also family and will be deeply missed.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of CBS</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In their own statement, CBS wrote of the news: “We are deeply saddened by the passing of David McCallum and privileged that CBS was his home for so many years.&nbsp;David was a gifted actor and author, and beloved by many around the world.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He led an incredible life, and his legacy will forever live on through his family and the countless hours on film and television that will never go away,” the statement continued. “We will miss his warmth and endearing sense of humor that lit up any room or soundstage he stepped onto, as well as the brilliant stories he often shared from a life well-lived. Our hearts go out to his wife Katherine and his entire family, and all those who knew and loved David.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A previously announced NCIS 20th anniversary marathon scheduled for CBS's Monday primetime block will now feature an “In Memoriam” card honoring McCallum.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and doing several years in repertory theater in the United Kingdom, the Scotland-born actor moved to America in 1961. He landed the role of Illya Kuryakin in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. opposite Robert Vaughn. He earned two Emmy and a Golden nomination for the role.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He recalled in a January 2023 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Emmys</a>, “I was out of work and had bills to pay, and [my friend, actor] Charlie Bronson knew that was the case. He said, ‘Why don't we have lunch in the commissary at MGM and we'll see what happens?’ So we went. When you're a kid from Glasgow who's watched movies growing up, and all of a sudden you're in this cathedral which is the MGM commissary, with all the pictures on the wall and people walking around who you've seen on the screen — I just was carried away.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I met Sam Rolfe [creator of The Man From U.N.C.L.E.] at that lunch, and I think a seed was planted. I was then called by my agent, who said, ‘You've been offered three television series. One is to play Alexander the Great. Another is to play Judas Iscariot’ — I'd just played Judas in The Greatest Story Ever Told — ‘And the other is a thing called Solo, which is based to a certain extent on the Bond books.’ It wasn't called Solo in the end because there was a conflict with the Bond rights, so it became The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">NCIS fans will remember McCallum as Chief Medical Examiner Donald "Ducky" Mallard who is a close friend of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mark Harmon</a>’s Leroy Jethro Gibbs and became a father figure to the cast of characters on the procedural. He recalled his interview with The Emmys how his character developed his signature look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Well, Don [Bellisario, creator of NCIS] insisted on that hat. He said, "He's got to wear a hat." I said, "We're shooting in two minutes." He said, ‘Well, get a hat,’” he said. “So I went up to wardrobe and I found that [stone-colored Fedora-shaped safari hat], which is still, twenty years later, Ducky's hat.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Now Ducky is retired. I decided to leave the show, and they said, ‘No, we'd like to make you the historian,’ which was very gratifying because it meant that CBS liked that I was around.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On the big screen, he took on roles in The Greatest Story Ever Told, The Great Escape, Mosquito Squadron, Billy Budd, Freud and A Night to Remember.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He was also featured on television shows including The Education of Max Bickford, Sapphire and Steel, Colditz, Trainer, VR5, Motherlove, Kidnapped, The Outer Limits, Law & Order and Sex and the City, and was a voice actor on the Toon Disney show The Replacements.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Off screen, McCallum recorded three albums of instrumental interpretations and originals, and published a novel Once a Crooked Man in 2016.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are no immediate plans for a memorial service — instead a celebration of life service will be held in the future.
