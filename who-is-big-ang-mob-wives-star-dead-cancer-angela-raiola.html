She was born the niece of <strong>Salvatore “Sally Dogs” Lombardi</strong>, an alleged captain of the Infamous Genovese crime family (the largest of the “Five Families” of New York City, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CNN</a>.)

Big Ang had a killer figure – literally!</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>It’s safe to say that Big Ang’s chest could be classified as a lethal weapon, but her to-die-for breasts were dangerous killers. Ang said in her book, Bigger Is Better, that a Catskills vacation with her family turned deadly, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Goodreads</a>. “Out of nowhere, this bat this bat flies right into my chest and then falls splat on the ground. Turned out, he died on impact.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>3. She worked hard to get her signature look (and had a lot of work done.)</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I had a tummy tuck, l liposuction, my lips injected and my breasts done three times,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Radar Online</a> in 2012. She said that her obsession with plastic surgery happened after she gave birth to her first child. “After I had the baby my boobs were dead. They just were prunes down to my waist,” she said, showcasing her sense of humor <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>that fans will dearly miss</a>. Ang&nbsp;was a fan of <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>changing her look</a>, and she ultimately had a 36J-sized bust!

She was also a proud grandmother to six grandchildren — the youngest, <strong>Anjolie Scotto</strong>, was born in Jan. 2016, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>UPI</a>. At least Anjolie got to meet her sweet grandma&nbsp;before her sad death.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>5. The Mob Wives&nbsp;star&nbsp;had her own a criminal record.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>It should be no surprise that Ang wasn’t a complete angel. She reportedly served four months under house arrest in 2003 after pleading guilty to selling cocaine in 2001, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Smoking Gun</a>. However, she will be remembered for her big heart, big laugh and the big love she shared with all her family and friends.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Our thoughts continue to go out to Big Ang’s family and friends during their time of loss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH1ze5BxZrCgn2K2tHnBop5mmZ6ceq67wWauoq6VqHq0wMCrZJ2dkZl6pK3NnJyrZZGjtKa4wGapmqGfoa5w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
